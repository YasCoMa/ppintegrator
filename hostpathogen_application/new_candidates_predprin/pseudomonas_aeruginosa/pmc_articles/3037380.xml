  The RACK1 Signaling Scaffold Protein Selectively Interacts with
 </title>
 <abstract>
  <p>
   Many Gram-negative bacteria use type III secretion systems to translocate effector proteins into host cells. These effectors interfere with cellular functions in a highly regulated manner resulting in effects that are beneficial for the bacteria. The pathogen
   <italic>
    Yersinia
   </italic>
   can resist phagocytosis by eukaryotic cells by translocating Yop effectors into the target cell cytoplasm. This is called antiphagocytosis, and constitutes an important virulence feature of this pathogen since it allows survival in immune cell rich lymphoid organs. We show here that the virulence protein YopK has a role in orchestrating effector translocation necessary for productive antiphagocytosis. We present data showing that YopK influences Yop effector translocation by modulating the ratio of the pore-forming proteins YopB and YopD in the target cell membrane. Further, we show that YopK that can interact with the translocators, is exposed inside target cells and binds to the eukaryotic signaling protein RACK1. This protein is engaged upon
   <italic>
    Y. pseudotuberculosis
   </italic>
   -mediated β1-integrin activation and localizes to phagocytic cups. Cells with downregulated RACK1 levels are protected from antiphagocytosis. This resistance is not due to altered levels of translocated antiphagocytic effectors, and cells with reduced levels of RACK1 are still sensitive to the later occurring cytotoxic effect caused by the Yop effectors. Further, a
   <italic>
    yopK
   </italic>
   mutant unable to bind RACK1 shows an avirulent phenotype during mouse infection, suggesting that RACK1 targeting by YopK is a requirement for virulence. Together, our data imply that the local event of
   <italic>
    Yersinia
   </italic>
   -mediated antiphagocytosis involves a step where YopK, by binding RACK1, ensures an immediate specific spatial delivery of antiphagocytic effectors leading to productive inhibition of phagocytosis.

     Introduction
    </title>
    <p>
     The genus
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>
     contains three pathogenic species:
     <italic>
      Yersinia pestis
     </italic>
     ,
     <italic>
      Yersinia enterocolitica
     </italic>
     and
     <italic>
      Yersinia pseudotuberculosis
     </italic>
     .
     <italic>
      Y. pestis
     </italic>
     , the causative agent of plague, where bubonic plague is the most common form, is usually transmitted by the bite of a flea and spread to regional lymph nodes after which it can enter the bloodstream and spread systemically
     . It is believed that
     <italic>
      Y. pestis
     </italic>
     replicate within macrophages during the early stages of infection at peripheral host sites
     ,
     ,
     , while extracellular growth is predominant during other stages of infection
     ,
     . The enteropathogenic species
     <italic>
      Y. pseudotuberculosis
     </italic>
     and
     <italic>
      Y. enterocolitica
     </italic>
     are transmitted by the oral-fecal route and penetrate the intestinal epithelium and spread to the lymphatic system (first Peyer\s patches and thereafter mesenteric lymph nodes) where they replicate extracellularly
     ,
     . Also enteropathogenic
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>
     species can grow within macrophages
     , but if this occurs during infection, like for
     <italic>
      Y. pestis
     </italic>
     , is still controversal. Common to all three
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>
     species is their ability to replicate extracellularly in lymphoid tissue where most other bacteria are effectively engulfed and destroyed by phagocytes. Pathogenic
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>
     bind phagocytes and can impair their phagocytic capacity as well as certain inflammatory responses
     ,
     ,
     ,
     ,
     . This permits bacterial survival and subsequent dissemination from these sites, resulting in systemic infection
     . The capacity to survive and multiply in lymphoid tissue and to inhibit several important host immune mechanisms, including phagocytosis, is an essential virulence property of this pathogen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The capacity of these three pathogenic
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>
     strains to multiply extracellularly and inhibit internalization by host cells depends on a virulence plasmid that encodes a common type three secretion system (T3SS) and virulence effectors such as the
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>
     outer proteins (Yops). The Yops include YopH, YopE, YopJ, YopM, YpkA, and YopK. Upon intimate contact with a target cell, these effectors are induced in the bacterium and delivered into the interacting host cell via a mechanism involving the plasmid encoded T3SS
     . Inside the target cell, the Yop effectors interfere with several key mechanisms of the host immune defense including phagocytosis, production of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules, and activation of the adaptive immune system
     ,
     . Intracellular growth is however not dependent on the virulence plasmid
     . Although most of the Yop effectors are necessary for
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>
     virulence, the exact mechanism underlying their individual roles is known only for a few
     . For example, YopE is a Rho-GAP protein that mediates effects on the actin cytoskeleton and YopH is a tyrosine phosphatase that disrupts host cell signaling necessary for phagocytosis. This favours antiphagocytosis allowing bacteria to preferentially replicate extracellularly
     ,
     ,
     ,
     ,
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     YopD, along with YopB and LcrV, is required for translocation of Yop effectors across the host cell plasma membrane. YopB and YopD contain hydrophobic domains indicative of transmembrane proteins and constituents of a pore
     ,
     . It is assumed that the Yop effectors pass through this pore when crossing the eukaryotic target cell membrane. Interestingly,
     <italic>
      yopK
     </italic>
     mutants form a larger pore and in line with this notion,
     <italic>
      yopK
     </italic>
     mutants overtranslocate Yop effectors
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     YopK is one of the least studied of the translocated Yop effectors. This 21-kDa protein is found in all three of the human pathogenic species (i.e.,
     <italic>
      Y. pestis
     </italic>
     ,
     <italic>
      Y. pseudotuberculosis
     </italic>
     , and
     <italic>
      Y. enterocolitica
     </italic>
     (YopQ)
     ,
     ,
     , but it has no homologues in any other bacteria that harbor a T3SS. YopK has been shown to influence the size of the translocation pore
     and is presumed to play a role in regulation of Yop effector translocation
     ,
     . This is supported by observations that a
     <italic>
      yopK
     </italic>
     deletion mutant generated larger pores and also over-delivered Yop effectors into target cells, whereas a strain overexpressing YopK reduced their translocation
     . However, a
     <italic>
      Y. pseudotuberculosis yopK
     </italic>
     mutant was also avirulent in orally infected mice; bacteria were cleared at the stage of Peyer\s patches, and never caused signs of systemic infection
     ,
     . Clearly therefore, YopK is essential for the ability of
     <italic>
      Y. pseudotuberculosis
     </italic>
     to cause full disease, via a hitherto unknown mechanism. Significantly, YopK is delivered into the target cell
     , which suggests that YopK has an intracellular target. In a recent report
     it was suggested that YopK prevents inflammasome activation by the T3SS. This conclusion was based on the correlative observation that
     <italic>
      yopK
     </italic>
     mutants in contrast to wild-type bacteria activated the inflammasome. However, this observed response to infection with
     <italic>
      yopK
     </italic>
     mutants can equally well be explained by larger pores allowing influx/efflux of ions such as Ca
     and K
     in addition to overtranslocation of effectors causing a stress response that activates the inflammasome.
    </p>
    <p>
     The aim of the present study was to elucidate a possible YopK effector function inside the host cell. We identified the eukaryotic signaling protein called receptor for activated C kinase (RACK1) as a potential target of YopK. RACK1 is a cytosolic WD-40 repeat protein that was originally identified as being bound to and stabilizing the active form of protein kinase C (PKC)
     . Additionally, RACK1 binds to β1-integrins
     ,
     ,
     , which also function as
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>
     receptors on the target cell surface
     . We found that YopK is required for productive delivery of Yop effectors and, together with an interaction with RACK1, is crucial for

     antiphagocytosis.

      null mutant of
      <italic>

      than by the corresponding isogenic wild-type strain
      . The size of the bacterial translocation pore is also increased in the absence of YopK
      . The
      <italic>
       Y. pseudotuberculosis
      </italic>
      translocation pore consists of the two hydrophobic translocator proteins YopB and YopD, which are inserted into the host cell membrane
      ,
      ,
      . Interestingly, hemolytic assays in the presence of
      S-cysteine- or
      S-methionine followed by purification of red blood cell membranes and subsequent autoradiography revealed that YopK, together with YopB and YopD, was associated with the erythrocyte membranes (
      , lanes 1–2). The presence of these proteins, but not the other bacterial extracellular proteins (LcrV and the adhesin Ail), in the membrane fraction was further verified by Western blot analysis (
      and
      ). Interestingly, quantification analysis revealed that the
      <italic>
       yopK
      </italic>
      null mutant inserted 4.4 times more of YopB (p = 0.04, n = 5) and 2.5 times more of YopD (p = 0,086, n = 5) in infected erythrocyte membranes compared to the wild-type bacteria. This increase in membrane associated translocators was not due to an increase in secretion, as the
      <italic>
       yopK
      </italic>
      null mutant secreted YopB and YopD to similar levels as the wild-type strain (data not shown). Importantly, the molar ratio between the two translocators determined by autoradiography was also altered: YopB/YopD was 0.71+/−0.025 for the mutant strain and 0.41+/−0.03 for the isogenic wild-type strain (
      ). In addition, purification of a His-tagged YopD from bacterial supernatants resulted in co-purification of YopK (
      ), and a reciprocal pull-down experiment using YopK–FLAG-coated beads showed co-precipitation of YopD (
      ), thus confirming that YopK associates with the translocator proteins
      . Furthermore, our data indicate that presence of YopK influences the pore composition where lack of YopK results in increased amounts of membrane associated translocator proteins resulting in a larger pore and as a consequence increased effector translocation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Given that YopK could associate with the translocation pore, we also confirmed that it was exposed on the cytosolic side of the host plasma membrane. To address this, we used a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based β-lactamase reporter assay that was developed to discriminate between extra- and intracellularly localized T3SS effectors
      ,
      . Expression constructs encoding YopK–β-lactamase fusion proteins were generated and introduced into

      and
      <italic>
       yopB

      null mutant strains; the latter strain was used as a translocation deficient control
      . Using fluorescence microscopy we detected delivery of the YopK-βlac fusion protein into HeLa cells infected with a
      <italic>
       yopK
      </italic>
      null mutant (

      YopK interacts with the host cell protein RACK1
     </title>
     <p>
      Since YopK is indeed translocated, we next sought to identify a eukaryotic target protein by using YopK as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen with a HeLa cell cDNA library. One of the positive clones identified encoded for the C-terminal portion (aa 71–317) of the scaffolding protein RACK1. This was particularly interesting since RACK1 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of β-integrins
      that serve as the receptors to which
      <italic>
       Y. pseudotuberculosis
      </italic>
      bind to establish contact with eukaryotic cells
      . To verify that the YopK-RACK1 interaction observed in yeast also occurred in HeLa cells (our established eukaryotic cell model system), we performed pull down assays using an expression construct (YopK–FLAG fusion) and HeLa cell lysates. In short, secreted YopK protein was immobilized on beads, which were subsequently incubated with HeLa cell lysate. Western blot analysis of YopK-associated proteins revealed binding between RACK1 and YopK–FLAG (
      ). This confirmed that YopK can interact with RACK1 in the eukaryotic cytosol, suggesting that this interaction is biologically relevant. To further explore the observed RACK1-YopK interaction, we performed additional pull down experiments, now using recombinant GST-RACK1 and supernatant from a multi-Yop mutant strain (unable to express YopE, YopH, YopM, YopB, YopD) expressing YopK. In brief, recombinant GST-RACK1 was immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads which were subsequently incubated with the
      <italic>
       Yersinia
      </italic>
      supernatant containing YopK. Western blot analysis of RACK1-associated proteins revealed binding between YopK and RACK1 (
      ), thus indicating that the binding of YopK to RACK1 is direct, and not mediated by a bridging eukaryotic molecule.
     </p>
     <p>
      To characterize the functional role of this interaction, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to map the respective interactive domains within both RACK1 and YopK. RACK1 forms a propeller-like structure that contains seven “blades” (domains 1 to 7), which consist of WD40 repeats that can bind to different ligands
      . In our analysis, domains 5 and 6 of RACK1 proved to be sufficient for YopK binding (
      ). Similarly, we generated and expressed different regions of YopK in the yeast system. This established that residues 30–59 were important for YopK to associate with RACK1 (
      ). To further map the interaction, we performed a pair-wise alanine scan of the RACK1-binding region in YopK. This revealed that amino acids 45 and 46 in YopK were essential for binding to RACK1 (
      ). Thus, we introduced these two amino acid changes (T45A, D46A) into the
      <italic>

      gene
      <italic>
       in cis

      on the virulence plasmid pIB102 of
      <italic>
       Y. pseudotuberculosis
      </italic>
      , which resulted in the mutant strain YPIII(pIB156) (
      ), hereafter denoted
      <italic>
       yopK
      </italic>
      . Phenotypic characterization revealed that this mutant was analogous to the
      <italic>
       yopK
      </italic>
      null mutant in key respects
      ,
      . Both strains maintained normal control of Yop expression and Yop secretion
      <italic>
       in vitro
      </italic>
      (data not shown) and the protease protection assay revealed that both strains translocated increased levels of Yop effectors into HeLa cells (
      ). Further, YopK
      was detected together with YopD and YopB in the plasma membrane of infected erythrocytes (
      , lane 3) and located to the cytosolic side of the HeLa cell membrane (
      , bottom left and right). Moreover, similar to the
      <italic>
       yop
      </italic>
      K mutant (described above), infection with the YopK
      -expressing strain also resulted in larger amounts of especially the translocator YopB (1.5 times more) in the target cell membrane resulting in an altered YopB/YopD ratio (0.52+/−0.04) compared to that seen with the wild-type strain (0.41+/−0.03). The observed effect on the translocator amount and ratio was however less prominent than that seen with the
      <italic>
       yopK
      </italic>
      mutant, which likely depends on presence of the mutated YopK
      .

      strains, respectively. During the course of infection, mice were visualized daily and analyzed for bioluminescence on days 3, 8, 10, and 13. All mice infected with wild-type bacteria showed clear signs of disease (ruffled fur and diarrhea) on days 4–6, whereas mice infected with either of the
      <italic>
       yopK
      </italic>
      mutant strains were apparently healthy. Analysis of total light emitted from the infected mice revealed that all were similarly colonized by the three
      <italic>

      strains during the first eight days. Thereafter, the signals from mice infected with either of the two
      <italic>
       yopK
      </italic>
      mutant strains declined, while signals from animals infected with the wild-type strain remained constant (
      ), showing a significant difference between the signals from mice infected with the wild-type strain compared to the two
      <italic>
       yopK
      </italic>
      mutants. Thus, the two

      antiphagocytosis requires RACK1
     </title>
     <p>
      RACK1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein that interacts with a large array of signaling molecules, regulating cellular functions such as adhesion, movement, and division
      . In particular, RACK1 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of β1-integrins
      and was also recently reported to bind focal adhesion kinase and participate in signaling from adhesion receptors
      . Given that β1-integrins constitute the eukaryotic cell receptors to which
      <italic>
       Yersinia pseudotuberculosis
      </italic>
      docks via its adhesin invasion
      , perhaps RACK1 participates in the bacterium-induced β1-integrin-mediated events. This idea was appealing because it could also mean that YopK binds to RACK1 to directly interfere with a signaling pathway that is important for host cell defense against the pathogen. To test this idea, we exposed HeLa cells to lentivirus-mediated RNAi of RACK1 to generate stable cell lines with downregulated RACK1 expression. A stable clone with 85% reduction of RACK1 expression (
      ) (hereafter denoted RACK1 RNAi cells) was selected for further investigation.

      An essential virulence feature of both enteropathogenic yersiniae and
      <italic>
       Y. pestis
      </italic>
      is the ability to block phagocytic uptake to avoid mechanisms of the innate host defense. Inhibition of internalization of the bacteria by eukaryotic cells has been demonstrated using professional phagocytes and was initially designated antiphagocytosis
      ,
      ,
      ,
      . Since the underlying mechanism of inhibition of internalization is similar in phagocytes and HeLa cells, the term antiphagocytosis is hereafter used for defining inhibition of bacterial internalization by both cell types (the term does not include the virulence plasmid independent avoidance of intracellular killing
      ). Non-opsonised
      <italic>
       Y. pseudotuberculosis
      </italic>
      is mainly internalized via the invasin-β1-integrin interaction in both these cell types
      ,
      ,
      ,
      . To ascertain whether RACK1 is involved in phagocytosis of
      <italic>
       Y. pseudotuberculosis
      </italic>
      or if it interferes with antiphagocytosis, we performed infection experiments using RACK1 RNAi cells and determined the amount of extracellular and intracellular bacteria. In agreement with previously reported results
      , the plasmid-cured avirulent
      <italic>
       Y. pseudotuberculosis
      </italic>
      strain YPIII was efficiently internalized by control HeLa cells (69% internalization) (
      ), whereas the corresponding wild-type strain remained largely extracellular (11% internalization) (
      ). Furthermore, the avirulent YPIII strain was still efficiently phagocytosed by the RACK1 RNAi cells (64% compared to 69% internalization by the HeLa control cells) (
      ). Hence, eukaryotic cells do not require RACK1 to internalize
      <italic>
       Yersinia
      </italic>
      . Surprisingly, the virulent wild-type strain displayed a significant reduction in the ability to block phagocytosis by RACK1 RNAi cells (43% internalization) (
      ). Analyses of bacterial adherence by counting total number of cell-associated bacteria revealed that the bacteria adhered to the RACK1 RNAi cells to similar extent as to the control cells. This implies that in the absence of RACK1, eukaryotic cells are protected from the
      <italic>
       Yersinia
      </italic>
      antiphagocytic attack. Notably, the absence of RACK1 could not protect RACK RNAi cells from antiphagocytosis induced by the
      <italic>
       yopK
      </italic>
      null mutant or the
      <italic>
       yopK
      </italic>
      mutant (
      and data not shown). In contrast, RACK1 RNAi cells were resistant towards the antiphagocytic activity of a
      <italic>

      -complemented
      <italic>
       yopK
      </italic>
      null mutant (
      ). While this might mean that YopK itself is an effector protein directly involved in the antiphagocytic mechanism, we could not find any evidence in support of this. Isogenic
      <italic>
       yopK
      </italic>
      and
      <italic>
       yopK

      mutants (both unable to express YopH, YopE, YopM, and YpkA) were indistinguishable from each other with respect to their ability to block phagocytosis in HeLa cells that were or were not expressing RACK1 (data not shown). Since YopK and RACK1 interact, a plausible interpretation of these surprising findings is that in the absence of RACK1, YopK has a negative impact on translocation control, either at the level of effector delivery or effector targeting.
     </p>
     <p>
      To confirm that the reduced antiphagocytic effect on RACK1 RNAi cells was actually due to the presence of lower levels of RACK1, and not an indirect effect of clonal selection or the RNAi procedure itself, we analyzed an additional RACK1 RNAi cell line with approximately similar level of RACK1 downregulation, but obtained with an oligo directed to another target sequence. Also this RACK1 RNAi cell line was resistant towards antiphagocytosis (
      ), thus excluding an eventual off-target effect. In addition, we included two other RACK1 RNAi cell lines in the analysis; one that displayed 60% downregulation of RACK1, while the second was not downregulated at all. Similar levels of antiphagocytosis were achieved by the wild-type strain in the cell line with undetectable RACK1 downregulation and the control HeLa cells (
      ). On the other hand, the extent of antiphagocytic activity was intermediate in the cells with 60% RACK1 downregulation compared to the level in cells with 85% downregulation (
      ). Thus, there was a direct dose-response correlation between the level of bacterial phagocytosis and the amount of RACK1. Hence, together these experiments show that the observed reduction in antiphagocytosis is linked to low levels of RACK1 in the target cells.

      Translocation of Yop effectors does not require RACK1
     </title>
     <p>
      To determine whether the level of RACK1 influences the amount of Yop effectors translocated, we employed two different methods to analyze T3SS-mediated translocation of effectors into eukaryotic cells: a translocation assay using the
      <italic>
       Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      </italic>
      effector ExoS
      and the protease protection assay
      . In the former technique, the ExoS-dependent ADP ribosylation of cytoplasmic proteins (e.g., Ras) allows sensitive detection of ExoS translocation into eukaryotic cells. We used the ExoS-producing
      <italic>
       Y. pseudotuberculosis
      </italic>
      strain YPIII(pIB526pTS103) (
      ) to infect control and RACK1 RNAi HeLa cells. Lysates were analyzed by Western blot to detect modification of Ras. Both cell lines displayed comparable levels of Ras modification, indicating that similar amounts of ExoS were translocated into the different cells (
      ). This agreed with the results of the protease protection assay where similar levels of the antiphagocytic effector YopE were translocated into the two cell types (
      ). Collectively, this implies that RACK1 does not affect the level of Yop effector translocation
      <italic>
       per se

      . Consequently, the reduced antiphagocytic capacity of

     </title>
     <p>
      Secondary to antiphagocytosis, prolonged infection of adherent cells induces cell rounding, which is often followed by detachment from the underlying substratum. This is due to YopE-mediated disruption of F-actin organization, an effect that is referred to as cytotoxicity
      . This cytotoxicity assay is often employed to evaluate the general effects of Yop effector function. We used the assay here to determine whether the YopK–RACK1 interaction is important also for this late and more devastating impact of prolonged exposure to the antiphagocytic effectors. Interestingly, the RACK1 RNAi cells and the control HeLa cells were equally affected by the cytotoxic capacity of the
      <italic>
       Y. pseudotuberculosis
      </italic>
      wild-type strain and also by the

      <italic>
       yopK
      </italic>
      mutant strains (
      ). Hence, the absence of RACK1, which protects cells from the immediate effects of antiphagocytosis, does not protect against the late onset global cytotoxic effects mediated by prolonged exposure to the bacteria. This shows that the YopK–RACK1 interaction is exclusively needed for the immediate local effect in close proximity to the bacterial attachment site, which represents the inhibitory influence of antiphagocytic effectors.

      RACK1 localizes to phagocytic cups
     </title>
     <p>
      Our finding that the RACK1–YopK interaction is a local event selectively important for antiphagocytosis prompted us to investigate the involvement of RACK1 in host cell signaling induced by cell surface binding of the bacteria. Upon infection,
      <italic>
       Y. pseudotuberculosis
      </italic>
      bind to, cluster, and activate β1-integrins
      , resulting in internalization of the bacteria in the absence of Yop effectors. Given that RACK1 interacts with the cytoplasmic part of β1-integrins and with associated signaling proteins
      ,
      it could possibly participate in signaling mechanisms activated by the bacterial binding. To test this, we analyzed the subcellular localization of RACK1 during β1-integrin-mediated cell spreading. In the spreading assay, cells were detached and allowed to rest before exposure to a surface coated with
      <italic>
       Y. pseudotuberculosis
      </italic>
      invasin encompassing the β1-integrin-binding region
      . Interestingly, while RACK1 was localized to the perinuclear area in routinely cultured HeLa cells (
      ), a fraction of RACK1 was transiently recruited to the cell edges during β1-integrin stimulated cell spreading (
      ). This was most prominent after 30 min incubation on the invasin-coated surface, by which time most of the cells had started to spread. Thus, RACK1 is recruited to areas of β1-integrin activation during initial spreading, which suggests that RACK1 participates in the early events of β1-integrin signaling. This is in agreement with a previous study suggesting that RACK1 can control initiation of cell spreading
      . Consequently, it is likely that an interaction between the bacterium and the host cell induces a corresponding recruitment of RACK1 to the bacterial binding site. To test this, we performed immunofluorescence analysis to visualize the localization of RACK1 in HeLa cells internalizing
      <italic>
       Y. pseudotuberculosis
      </italic>
      . In support of our hypothesis, RACK1 was found in association with phagocytic cups, where the bacteria were partially surrounded by the HeLa cell membrane (
      ). This implies that RACK1 is engaged during β1-integrin-mediated internalization of
      <italic>
       Yersinia
      </italic>
      , and is recruited to intracellular areas that are near an extracellularly located bacterium. Together with our data showing that YopK is connected to the translocation complex and exposed on the cytosolic side of the host cell plasma membrane, the data collectively strengthen our hypothesis that YopK targets RACK1 in the host cell.

     Pathogenic
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>
     species utilize a powerful T3SS to deliver effector proteins into the interior of the targeted host cells
     . A set of translocator proteins form a pore in the host cell membrane through which these effectors are thought to gain access into the host cell cytosol. This virulence mechanism allows these bacteria to purposefully block innate immune cell defense mechanisms such as phagocytosis so they can proliferate in lymphatic tissue
     . However, the phagocytic process is initiated as soon as a bacterium comes in contact with a target cell and completed within minutes after cell contact. Therefore, it is assumed that pathogenic
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>
     battle to impair this process via a very rapid and precise mechanism for effector delivery and action. In line with this, we have previously shown that Yop effector deployment and intracellular activity can be measured within 30 seconds after the bacterium makes contact with a host cell
     ,
     . Nevertheless, extreme rapidity alone would not be sufficient; individual Yops would also need targeting to the precise site of action. Regulation of this process in the bacterium occurs on several levels; this includes coordinating target cell contact with induction of gene expression
     , subsequent feed-back repression
     , and via control of effector translocation
     . We have presented data in this study to support a mechanism that guarantees productive antiphagocytic effector translocation leading to an instant blockage of phagocytosis. It relies upon an interaction in the host cell between YopK, which is associated with the pore complex, and the eukaryotic protein RACK1.
    </p>
    <p>
     We observed that RACK1 was specifically required for antiphagocytosis. This was based on the finding that host cells downregulated for RACK1 expression engulfed the pathogen to a much greater extent compared to cells with normal RACK1 expression, implying that these RACK1 RNAi cells are resistant to the antiphagocytic activity of the T3SS. This was quite unexpected; making it the first reported cell line to be impervious to the action of the
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>
     antiphagocytic machinery. Importantly, virulence effectors were translocated to the same extent into cells regardless of their RACK1 expression level and these intracellular effectors still induced a normal cytotoxic response in both cell lines. This means two things; firstly, translocation of effectors and the process of cytotoxicity induction do not require RACK1, and secondly, antiphagocytosis and cytotoxicity are clearly two distinct events during cell infection. Another striking feature was that the ability of the pathogen to mediate antiphagocytosis towards RACK1 RNAi cells diminished significantly when YopK was present. Notably, this failure to inactivate the critical cellular targets and interrupt phagocytosis occurred despite efficient antiphagocytic Yop effector translocation into the target cells. Hence, the discrepancy between
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>
     YopK
     bacteria inducing an uncompromising cytotoxic response on the one hand, but failing to establish antiphagocytosis on the other, suggests that the latter process requires specific features of the effector translocation process that are overseen by YopK. This agrees with our previous results concerning the antiphagocytic effector and major cytotoxin YopE
     ; certain
     <italic>
      yopE
     </italic>
     point mutants exhibited attenuated virulence but still gave rise to cytotoxicity in HeLa cells. Thus, the cytotoxic effect is actually a secondary event that occurs only after prolonged infection and is dispensable for
     <italic>
      in vivo
     </italic>
     virulence. On the other hand, there appears to be a direct correlation between the ability of
     <italic>
      Y. pseudotuberculosis
     </italic>
     to resist phagocytosis and to cause systemic infections in mice. This is based on the fact that except translocation-deregulated
     <italic>
      yopK
     </italic>
     mutants, no other attenuated Yop effector mutant possesses full antiphagocytic capacity. In fact, mutants defective in antiphagocytosis are cleared at the initial stage of infection in Peyer\s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes
     ,
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     YopK and antiphagocytosis are inextricably linked. For several years, YopK has been suspected to affect the Yop translocation pore
     . Herein, we show that YopK localized with the translocators YopB and YopD in the membrane fraction of infected cells. In addition, YopK can be found inside infected host cells – presumably at the zone of bacteria-host cell contact. Interestingly, we observed that RACK1 also accumulates at the site of bacterial attachment to host cells and immediately upon activation of β1-integrins. We believe that this RACK1 localization is a prerequisite for productive blocking of phagocytosis since such a location would enable RACK1 to interact with YopK associated with the T3SS. Indeed, using independent protein-protein binding assays, we could demonstrate this interaction. Together, these data suggest that YopK functions as a sensor and mediator of productive effector translocation. Thus, it is feasible that the YopK-RACK1 binding contributes to efficient antiphagocytosis where the association of YopK with the translocation pore ensures that translocated effector proteins are immediately exposed to their key target(s) represented by signaling proteins involved in β1-integrin-mediated internalization. Interesting in this context is that RACK1, located at peripheral initial adhesion structures, has been shown to bind to focal adhesion kinase
     , which constitutes a target of the antiphagocytic effector YopH
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     From this work, we suggest that RACK1 serves as a recognition site for YopK to obtain a precise spatial translocation of antiphagocytic effectors allowing instant targeting of the phagocytic machinery. At first glance however, this might be difficult to reconcile considering that antiphagocytosis works fine in the absence of YopK, or both YopK and RACK1, but not in the absence of RACK1. In this respect, consider the critical finding that RACK1 RNAi cells resist the antiphagocytic effect of wild type
     <italic>
      Y. pseudotuberculosis
     </italic>
     , but not of the
     <italic>
      yopK
     </italic>
     mutants. Thus, the key to unlocking this conundrum is to understand how
     <italic>
      yopK
     </italic>
     mutants suppress the RACK1 minus phenotype. The most likely reason for this is that these mutants show an overtranslocation phenotype, resulting in excessive delivery of Yop effectors into the host cell
     . Although effector delivery in the absence of YopK would be random and unorganized, their shear excess inside the cell will ensure that they still find and inactivate the critical target(s) within the necessary time-frame. Therefore, this excess of effectors would overcome any need for YopK-RACK1 recognition; after all, only in the presence of YopK is RACK1 required for antiphagocytosis! Consistent with this is the avirulent phenotype of
     <italic>
      yopK
     </italic>
     mutants; surplus delivery of effectors is clearly detrimental for bacterial survival
     <italic>
      in vivo
     </italic>
     . The
     <italic>
      yopK
     </italic>
     mutants were cleared after a week of infection, likely as a consequence of damaging effects on host cells resulting in increased recruitment of immune cells and/or inundating the host with antigenic epitopes against which it can trigger a more robust and effective immune response. These mutants might also display reduced
     <italic>
      in vivo
     </italic>
     fitness because of the high energetic cost associated with Yop effector over-translocation. Whatever the reason(s), it suggests that RACK1 targeting by YopK is a key step in the controlled, target-directed process of effector delivery and a requirement for virulence. Antiphagocytosis by
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>
     is immediate, which contrasts to other pathogenic bacteria harboring a T3SS such as Enteropathogenic
     <italic>
      E. coli
     </italic>
     (EPEC) and Enterohemorrhagic
     <italic>

     </italic>
     (EHEC) that can induce an antiphagocytosis-like response after prolonged bacteria-host cell exposure
     ,
     ,
     ,
     . Since YopK is unique to the
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>

     <italic>

     </italic>
     during the extracellular stages of infection.

      Y. pestis

     do not express a functional invasin, but the adhesins Ail and Pla bind the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin that can interact with β1-integrins
     . This pathogen that is more virulent than the enteropathogenic strains and exhibits an extremely efficient growth in lymph nodes during late phases of infection is also equipped with an antiphagocytic capsule, which likely contributes
     ,
     . Taken together, based on our data, we suggest a hypothetical model of this YopK-RACK1 interplay that would account for the ability of
     <italic>
      Yersinia
     </italic>
     to cause an instant phagocytic block (
     ). In this model, antiphagocytosis involves action at a distance from the bacterial surface where YopK ensures specific spatial delivery of antiphagocytic effectors using RACK1 as a marker for an active phagocytic signaling machinery.

      -βlac were diluted in fresh MEM and induced for Yop expression. HeLa cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 for 3 hr. For microscopy, the FRET-based fluorescent β-lactamase substrate CCF2-AM (Invitrogen) was prepared according to the manufacturer\s instructions and added directly to the cells. Cells were incubated for 1 hr in the dark at room temperature and then washed twice, fixed, and mounted using ultimate mounting medium (UMM)
      . Samples were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop), and images were captured using a CCD camera (Hamamatsu Orca C4742-95). The HeLa cells appeared green if there had been no translocation of Yop–β-lactamase fusions, whereas they were blue if they contained such fusions in their cytoplasm.

Prior to imaging, the mice were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane (IsoFlu®Vet, Orion Pharma Animal Health, Sweden) mixed with oxygen supplied from an XG1-8 gas system (Caliper Life Sciences). Images were acquired and analyzed using LivingImage software (Caliper Life Sciences). Total photon emission was recorded for each animal, and the light emitted from each individual mouse was quantified using the Region of Interest (ROI) tool.
