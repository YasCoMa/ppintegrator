   Numerous studies have shown that T

   17 cells and their signature cytokine IL-17A are critical to host defense against various bacterial and fungal infections. The protective responses mediated by T

   17 cells and IL-17A include the recruitment of neutrophils, release of antimicrobial peptides and chemokines, and enhanced tight junction of epithelial cells. Due to the importance of T

   17 cells in infections, efforts have been made to develop T

   17-based vaccines. The goal of vaccination is to establish a protective immunological memory. Most currently approved vaccines are antibody-based and have limited protection against stereotypically different strains. Studies show that T-cellâ€“based vaccines may overcome this limitation and protect hosts against infection of different strains.
