   from host cell vacuoles, thereby allowing replicationin the cytosol without causing appreciable cell death. As a member of thecholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) family of pore-forming toxins, LLO isunique in that it is secreted by a facultative intracellular pathogen, whereasall other CDCs are produced by pathogens that are largely extracellular.Replacement of LLO with other CDCs results in strains that are extremelycytotoxic and 10,000-fold less virulent in mice. LLO has structural andregulatory features that allow it to function intracellularly without causingcell death, most of which map to a unique N-terminal region of LLO referred toas the PEST-like sequence. Yet, while LLO has unique properties required for itsintracellular site of action, extracellular LLO, like other CDCs, affects cellsin a myriad of ways. Because all CDCs form pores in cholesterol-containingmembranes that lead to rapid Ca   influx and K   efflux,they consequently trigger a wide range of host cell responses, including MAPKactivation, histone modification, and caspase-1 activation. There is no debatethat extracellular LLO, like all other CDCs, can stimulate multiple cellularactivities, but the primary question we wish to address in this perspective iswhether these activities contribute to
