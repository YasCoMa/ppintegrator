  State-of-the-art polymeric nanoparticles as promising therapeutic tools against human bacterial infections
 </title>
 <abstract>
  <p id="Par1">
   Infectious diseases kill over 17 million people a year, among which bacterial infections stand out. From all the bacterial infections, tuberculosis, diarrhoea, meningitis, pneumonia, sexual transmission diseases and nosocomial infections are the most severe bacterial infections, which affect millions of people worldwide. Moreover, the indiscriminate use of antibiotic drugs in the last decades has triggered an increasing multiple resistance towards these drugs, which represent a serious global socioeconomic and public health risk. It is estimated that 33,000 and 35,000 people die yearly in Europe and the United States, respectively, as a direct result of antimicrobial resistance. For all these reasons, there is an emerging need to find novel alternatives to overcome these issues and reduced the morbidity and mortality associated to bacterial infectious diseases. In that sense, nanotechnological approaches, especially smart polymeric nanoparticles, has wrought a revolution in this field, providing an innovative therapeutic alternative able to improve the limitations encountered in available treatments and capable to be effective by theirselves. In this review, we examine the current status of most dangerous human infections, together with an in-depth discussion of the role of nanomedicine to overcome the current disadvantages, and specifically the most recent and innovative studies involving polymeric nanoparticles against most common bacterial infections of the human body.

     Introduction

    <p id="Par29">
     Infectious diseases kill over 17 million people a year over the world [
     ]. Bacterial infections have a large impact on public health. Drug-resistant bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi cause 700,000 deaths every year worldwide [
     ]. The latest
     <italic>
      Global Health Study
     </italic>
     undertaken by the World Health Organization (WHO) dated from 2016, estimated that infectious and parasitic diseases represent 9.7% from the whole deaths worldwide. In this ranking, tuberculosis has been placed as the first cause of death among bacterial infections (2.3% of global deaths), followed by diarrhoeal bacterial diseases (2%), meningitis (0.5%), bacterial sexual transmission disease (syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea, 0.2%) and encephalitis (0.2%) [
     ]. Similarly, the latest reports of the
     <italic>
      Global Burden of Diseases
     </italic>
     consortium highlighted that, in 2016, infectious diarrhoea was the eighth leading cause of death among all ages and the fifth leading cause of death among children, being
     <italic>
      Shigella
     </italic>
     and enterotoxigenic
     <italic>
      Escherichia coli
     </italic>
     the most frequent and mortal bacteria [
     ,
     ]; incident cases of meningitis globally increased 2.82 million in 2016, being the
     <italic>
      Pneumococcus
     </italic>
     the largest cause of years of life lived with disability (YLDs) [
     ]; the number of tuberculosis deaths was 1.21 million among HIV-negative individuals and 0.24 million among HIV-positive individuals [
     ]. Furthermore, in 2017, 11.0 million sepsis-related deaths were reported worldwide [
     ].
    </p>
    <p id="Par30">
     Not surprisingly, these data are significantly higher than the global computation in developing countries, since the lack of universal health systems, public health problems and access to potable drinking water, together with the limited financial resources, aggravate the situation of these patients [
     ,
     ]. On the other hand, the indiscriminate use of antibiotic drugs in recent decades worldwide has generated a global public health problem due to the emergence of multiple resistance against antibiotics by a high number of microorganisms [
     ]. It is predicted that, by 2050, multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria will cause up to 10 million deaths annually, with a burden cost in the global economy reaching US$100 trillion [
     ].

     Although the human body lives together with its own microbiota in an advantageous symbiosis, there are many bacteria pathogens capable to infect and colonize the human body and cause serious diseases (Table
     ). Bacteria can be transmitted to humans through food, water, air, or living vectors. All of the human organs are susceptible to be infected by bacteria, but each species has a predilection for certain organs, and some organs are more sensitive to suffer bacterial infection (Fig.
     ) [
     ]. "ESKAPE" bacteria is one of the groups of bacteria that are of greatest concern in the health environment due to several reasons. ESKAPE is an acronym encompassing the names of six most dangerous bacterial human pathogens (
     <italic>
      Enterococcus faecium

     , and
     <italic>
      Enterobacter

     species) commonly associated with a high antimicrobial resistance, which are responsible of the majority of nosocomial infections. Curiously, this acronym also references to the ability of these microorganism to escape the effects of commonly used antibiotics through evolutionarily developed mechanisms [
     ].
    </p>
    <p id="Par32">
     Other of the most dangerous bacteria for humans are
     <italic>
      Neisseria meningitides
     </italic>
     and
     <italic>
      Vibrio cholera,
     </italic>
     both belonging to the proteobacteria phylum
     <italic>
      N. meningitides
     </italic>
     is an exclusively human pathogen, causing bacterial meningitis in children and young adults, which finally lead to the death of the ten percent of the cases [
     ]. People with confirmed
     <italic>
      N. meningitidis
     </italic>
     infection should be hospitalized immediately for antibiotic treatment due to the severity of the symptoms [
     ]. On its behalf,
     <italic>
      V. cholerae
     </italic>
     causes cholera in humans. This pathogen is usually transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water [
     ].
     <italic>
      V. cholerae
     </italic>
     infection is limited to the intestinal tract, where disease symptoms are primarily caused by its toxins. It is mostly found in developing countries, since the lack of access to drinking water promotes its expansion, becoming an endemic disease in these regions [
     ].
    </p>
    <p id="Par33">
     <italic>
      Clostridium difficile
     </italic>
     is the most important cause of pseudomembranous colitis, an infection of the colon, often secondary to the eradication of the saprophyte microbiota. Antibiotics, especially broad-spectrum antibiotics, cause an imbalance of the intestinal flora, leading to an overpopulation of
     <italic>
      C. difficile
     </italic>
     , which in turn promotes the pseudomembranous colitis [
     ]. Due to the severity of this infection, monoclonal antibodies and drugs such Surotomycin, Rifamixin or Cadazolid are being studied in clinical trials as promising alternatives to currently available treatments [
     ].
    </p>
    <p id="Par34">
     <italic>
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis
     </italic>
     is responsible for the largest number of tuberculosis cases and the first cause of death in the world due to bacterial infection. Humans are the only known reservoirs of
     <italic>
      M. tuberculosis
     </italic>
     , which causes severe infection in lungs, but also spreading to other organs [
     ]. Importantly, the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall deeply difficult the efficacy of the treatments, since drug penetration is almost impossible. [

     Finally,

     is the most common infectious cause of blindness and the most common sexually transmitted bacterium [

    <p id="Par36">
     All these facts together highlight the global importance and severity of the antibiotic resistance issue, which arises the need to find new alternatives for these patients. In this sense, nanomedicine has become in the last decades in a revolutionary therapeutic tool [
     ]. The ability of controlled drug delivery systems to carry inside different antibiotics, enhance their solubility, target them to a specific organ and improve its penetration has opened a window of opportunities to overcome the disadvantages of the current antibiotic treatments and novel potential molecules [
     ]. Moreover, the possibility of accumulate the drug at the site of infection for a longer time, as well as avoiding the escape mechanisms of bacteria generate a great interest among the scientific community [
     ].
    </p>
    <p id="Par37">
     Specifically, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as a promising alternative mainly due to the polymeric structure. Polymeric materials have exhibited to possess antibiotic effects [
     ]. Among their several effects, it is highlighted their ability to accumulate onto the cell membranes, which finally promote the destruction of the entire bacteria cell. These polymer effects together with antibacterial properties of loaded drugs confers to these nanosystems many advantages as a multitarget approach against different infections [
     ]. Thus, in this review we deeply investigate and describe the main advantages of nanomedicine, specifically the state-of-the-art polymeric NPs, against most common human bacterial infections, as well as recent advances in novel drugs-loaded polymeric NPs as antibiotic therapies.

     Nanoparticles to improve antibacterial therapies
    </title>
    <p id="Par38">
     In the 1940s, penicinils promoted a revolution in the therapy of the twentieth century, significantly contributing to the control of infectious diseases, which were the leading cause of human mortality so far [
     ]. Due to this therapeutic success, over the last 50 decades, there was an indiscriminate use of these drugs, which led to several antibiotic resistances by many bacterial species, which implies a serious public health risk. Spontaneous modifications in the genetic material of these microorganisms improved their adaptation to the environment and the development of molecular mechanisms that limit the action of these agents, such as the production of degrading enzymes or the increase in their efflux pumps [
     ]. It is estimated that 33,000 and 35,000 people die yearly in Europe and the United States, respectively, as a direct result of antimicrobial resistance [
     ,
     ].
    </p>
    <p id="Par39">
     For these reasons, the is a current need to improve the biopharmaceutical properties of existing compounds and also to find new, more effective antibacterial agents. Recent advances in nanotechnology, particularly the design of novel nanoparticles (NPs) as controlled drug delivery systems, have supposed a promising alternative impact in the general medicine, and specifically in the antimicrobial therapy [
     ]. NPs, controlled drug delivery systems with a diameter of 1–1000 nm and polymeric core, may offer remarkable improvements in the biopharmaceutical properties of antibacterial agents. Notably, they can provide an enhancement of drug solubility, modulation of drug release and delivery, promotion of stealth for immune evasion, targeting of antibacterial molecules to desired organs and tissues and increase the retention time in-situ, as well as the simultaneous delivery of multiple drugs [
     ]. Such unique advantages allow these systems to improve the therapeutic index of drug payloads when compared with free drug counterparts, perform an efficient focused therapy at the site of infection, increasing the penetration of loaded molecules through the bacteria cell wall, thus opening a window against antibacterial resistance [
     ].
    </p>
    <p id="Par40">
     Different strategies by which NPs can improve antibacterial therapy efficacy have already been described (Fig.
     ) [
     ,
     ]. The most important strategy is the antibiotic localization to the pathogen cell. This allows to reduce the therapeutic doses of the drugs, maintaining their efficacy and reducing the adverse effects [
     ]. The modulation of drug-pathogen interaction to overcome antibiotic resistance is another of the most effective strategies. For example, liposomes have the capacity of fusing themselves directly with bacterial membranes. This leads to a burst-release of high dose of loaded antibiotics into the bacteria, overwhelming the efflux pumps and overcoming this bacterial resistance mechanism [
     ]. NPs enable free drug “anti-virulence” therapy. In comparison to traditional antibiotics, nanoparticles are less likely to develop drug resistance, since there is no bactericidal effect, but rather promoted physical and non-specific structural disruption of bacterial membranes, that ultimately led to an increased permeation and bacterial cell death. This process is less likely to elicit resistance development [
     ]. Furthermore, some anti-virulence platforms include monoclonal antibodies, anti-sera, small-molecule inhibitors or small polymers [
     ].

      Nanoparticles for bacteria recognition
     </title>
     <p id="Par41">
      The recognition of bacteria by detecting specific elements with NPs, which would act as biosensors, is one of the most innovative and emerging strategies to rapidly recognise and treat an infection. The large surface area of nanoparticles allows, not only the increase of the contact between loaded drug and bacterial film, but also a more efficient recruiting of bacterial antigens. Thus, different strategies have been explored in that sense.

       Antibody-based strategies
      </title>
      <p id="Par42">
       NPs surface modification with specific antibodies comprises the most commonly used bio-recognition approach to capture pathogens cells due to their versatility and their high affinity to different bacteria elements. Polyclonal, monoclonal, and engineered antibody fragments are the antibodies employed in immunology-based assays in bacterial infections [
       ].

       Aptamer-based strategies
      </title>
      <p id="Par43">
       Aptamers are single stranded nucleic acids which offer many advantages over antibody-based strategies. These advantages include their chemical stability, low-cost, and large-scale synthesis process. Moreover, due to their small size (between 3 and 5 nm), aptamers exhibit a remarkable binding affinity against different bacterial cell elements, thus resulting in a significant reduction of the detection limit [
       ]. Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment (SELEX) technique is commonly used in the design of aptamers for a huge variety of bacteria [
       ]. This technique is based on the identification and amplification of an effective aptamer sequence, which will be conjugated with -COOH –SH and -NH

       Electrostatic interaction-based strategies

      <p id="Par44">
       Positively charged nanoparticles can bind to negatively charged protein surfaces, such bacteria cell membrane, through electrostatic interactions. Several type of nanoparticles, such as chitosan nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, graphene oxide nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes, have been reported to interact with bacteria elements, such enzymes, and inhibiting their activities. Moreover, due to the reversible characteristic of electrostatic interactions, this recognition’s process can be used as an indirect indicator of bacterial cell concentration [
       ].

       Bacteriophage-based strategies
      </title>
      <p id="Par45">
       Bacteriophages are basic bacteria-infecting viruses comprised by a protein capsid evolving of nucleic acids and tail fibres. These tail fibres are used as recognition elements, which can specifically bind to bacterial surface receptors. The most important characteristic of bacteriophages is their ability to distinguish inactive versus viable host cells, since they can only replicate within alive bacterial cells [
       ]. In addition, their synthesis and purification processes are relatively easy and inexpensive, together with their medium size (ca. 100 nm), making them a promising biosensoring platform to be combined with NPs for bacteria detection [
       ].

      Nanoparticles to protect and improve drug effectiveness
     </title>
     <p id="Par46">
      The targeting and recognition of specific bacterial structures is not the only strategy to improve antibacterial therapies using nanotechnology. The encapsulation of available antibiotics to improve their properties, as well as new molecules with bactericidal potential, is one of the main objectives of NPs. Likewise, the preservation of the physicochemical properties of encapsulated compounds, as well as an increase in their stability throughout their storage and administration in vivo, are fundamental characteristics provided by nanocarriers that provide a guarantee of success in therapies.
     </p>
     <p id="Par47">
      Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the compounds that as raised much interest in the last years because of its antibacterial properties. NO has been recently identified as a key regulator of bacterial biofilm dispersion, but its reduced water solubility, short half-life and extremely reactiveness involve a challenge to exploit its therapeutic potential [
      ]. In that sense, Duong et al
      <italic>
       .
      </italic>
      developed two different NO-loaded controlled drug delivery systems: (i) functional gold NPs and (ii) core cross-linked star polymers to improve the stability of NO during the storage and perform a controlled release [
      ,
      ]. Both systems were exposed to
      <italic>
       Pseudomonas
      </italic>
      biofilms and NO dispersant activity was evaluated. In both cases, nanosystems increased NO stability, showed a slow and controlled delivery of NO, and exhibited a great efficacy in preventing both cell attachment and biofilm formation, with no signals of toxic mechanisms.
     </p>
     <p id="Par48">
      Similarly, another interesting study explored the co-encapsulation of NO and gentamicin in poly-oligo(ethyleneglycol) methyl ether methacrylate NPs as a potential antibacterial tool against bacterial biofilm and planktonic cultures [
      ]. Gentamicin is an aminoglucoside widely used in several bacterial infections, but with serious ear and kidney toxicity. In this study, authors founded that developed NPs were able to perform a controlled release both agents simultaneously, and exhibited synergistic effects. The viability of planktonic cultures and
      <italic>
       Pseudomonas
      </italic>
      biofilm was reduced by more than 95% and 90%, respectively, whereas free drugs treatments alone resulted in less than 20% of decrease in biofilm viability.
     </p>
     <p id="Par49">
      Another antibacterial strategy exploited with nanotechnology is the increase of the temperature in the infected area. It has been described that this increase can induce a detachment of bacteria biofilms and reduction of biofilm biomass. In that sense, Nguyen et al
      <italic>
       .
      </italic>
      developed iron oxide NPs to disrupt the bacterial biofilm through a NPs-mediated hyperthermia [
      ]. Upon an exposure to a magnetic field, developed NPs induced the detachment of biofilm cells and reduced by 2-log the number of colony forming units (CFUs) in both biofilm and planktonic phases in combination with gentamicin treatment.

      All these findings together may find broad applications across a range of clinical and industrial settings related to bacterial infections management.

     Polymers as a new generation of antibacterial agents
    </title>
    <p id="Par51">
     In the last decade, mainly due to the rise of antibacterial drugs resistance, there has been an increase in the search of new compounds able to act against these microorganisms. In this context, antimicrobial polymers (AMP) have emerged as a promising alternative in this field [
     ]. As described above, polymers by themselves have shown to be promising therapeutic agents against multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria. These materials were designed to mimic the chemical structure of antimicrobial peptides, which are part of the human immune system and are responsible of the protection of the host against different pathogen [
     ]. Hydrophobicity and cationic charge have been described as the most important properties of these materials to possess antibacterial activity. These characteristics lead to an accumulation of these polymers onto the cell membranes, creating pores on the bacterial structure, thus finally killing them [
     ].
    </p>
    <p id="Par52">
     The composition and distribution of the monomers in the polymer chain have been also described to possess a significant impact in the antibacterial activity. Some studies have pointed out that the incorporation of hydrophobic and amine groups in the terminal positions of the polymer chain allows to vary its hydrophobicity and lead to adjust the extent of bacterium membrane disruption, which in turn governs the antimicrobial activity [
     ,
     ]. Furthermore, it has been also described that the incorporation of oligoethylene glycol in the polymeric structure prevent the complexation of AMP with proteins, which significantly contributes to maintain antimicrobial efficacy [
     ]. Likewise, polymer architecture also influences in its bactericidal effect. It has been described that polymer longer chains are more bacteriostatic against Gram-negative bacteria, whereas polymer shorter chains have less haemocompatibility. Moreover, hyperbranched polymeric structures possess similar antimicrobial activity compared to the short linear random copolymers with no hemagglutination [
     ].
    </p>
    <p id="Par53">
     Due to their inhering chemical structure, AMP can either promote antibacterial effect or serve as matrix to improve the efficacy of loaded antibiotics [
     ]. Synergistic effect between AMP and antibiotics have been described by several authors. Thus, Namivandi-Zangeneh et al
     <italic>
      .
     </italic>
     recently developed an antimicrobial platform composed by a potent synthetic AMP (oligoethylene glycol, ethylhexyl, and primary amine groups) and two antibiotics, colistin and doxycycline [
     ]. This study reveals the improvement.
    </p>
    <p id="Par54">
     of the bacteriostatic efficacy of both AMP and antibiotics when administered together. Moreover, this synergistic combination reduces the rate of resistance development compared to free compounds alone. Similarly, authors recently developed another platform where this AMP was combined with essential oils, carvacrol and eugenol [
     ]. Essential oils are natural antimicrobial agents produced by many plants. As it was expected, co-administration of these compounds significantly improves the efficacy against
     <italic>
      P. aeruginosa
     </italic>
     biofilms compared to free compounds. In this case, the synergistic bactericidal activity was attributed to the targeted delivery of carvacrol and eugenol, driven by the electrostatic interaction between positively polymer and negatively charged bacteria.
    </p>
    <p id="Par55">
     Ultimately, the versatility in the design of polymers has allowed to exploit all these advantages and obtain different polymeric structures with antimicrobial activity.

      Polymers mimicking natural peptides
     </title>
     <p id="Par56">
      Natural peptides are commonly produced as an innate immune response against bacterial infections [
      ,
      ]. The mechanism of action use to be non-receptor dependent and use to involve an interruption of internal cellular function [
      ,
      ]. However, the clinical application of these peptides possesses several limitations because of their potential toxicity to the host, reduced half-life caused by protein binding, and susceptibility to degradation by host proteases [
      ]. To overcome these disadvantages, in the last years, a variety of polymers have been designed to simulate these natural peptides. Thus, many studies have described synthetic AMP mimicking peptides against most common human bacteria, such

      Other option of polymer strategy against bacteria are polysulphonium and polyphosphonium. Their mechanism of action is similar to those polymers which enclose quaternary ammonium in their structure, inducing a bacteria cell wall damage leading to their death [
      ]. These kind of matrices have been restricted to alkyl and aryl derivatives, which exhibit both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, a required feature to possess antimicrobial activity [

      Bacterial skin infections e.g. folliculitis, impetigo, furunculosis, and wound infections, among others, are the most common type of skin infections [
      ]. Recent studies have explored the potential of PNPs as a promising therapeutic alternative for skin infections (Table
      ). The major problem resulting from wound infections caused by MRSA is the colonization of other organs, which lead to an invasive and deep infection, resulting in systemic bacteraemia and significant morbidity and mortality. Related to this, Hasan et al

      developed mixed PNPs based on PLGA/PEI with loaded clindamycin, a semisynthetic antibiotic, derived from lincomycin, effective against aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. The developed nanocarrier was tested in a MRSA culture and ICR mice model of cutaneous wound infection [
      ]. Authors found that developed PNPs are able to efficiently bind to the MRSA surface, thus enhancing the bactericidal activity of clindamycin. Moreover, clindamycin-loaded PNPs significantly accelerate the healing and re-epithelialization of wounds in the in vivo assay, without compromising the healthy fibroblast cells activity.

In this context, Ong and colleges designed chitosan NPs carrying malasyan propolis to evaluate their efficacy against this opportunistic pathogen [

Moreover, propolis-loaded PNPs downregulate genes involved in intercellular bacteria adhesion, and exhibit a synergism with ciprofloxacin, rifampicin, doxycycline and vancomycin. Thus, combination therapy represents a way of tackling antibiotic resistance in

Thus, by using a LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit, authors demonstrated that developed PNPs possess a high antibacterial activity to the bacterial cells forming the biofilm, establishing a suitable drug delivery system to enhance the potential of polymeric nanocarriers for treating biofilm infections.

      Urinary tract infections are the most common outpatient infections, with a lifetime incidence of 50 − 60% in adult women [

In addition, polymer-coated silver NPs also promote a downregulation of the expression of genes associated with the citric acid cycle and amino acid metabolism, which are involved in the cellular growth of

      Similarly, Alfaro-Viquez et al. developed proanthocyanidin-chitosan NPs against bacterial colonization of gut epithelial cells by extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) [
      ]. ExPEC are the primary cause of urinary tract infections, of which 20% to 45% have shown resistance to antibiotics [
      ]. Cranberry proanthocyanidins have widely shown to be effective in the treatment of acute cystitis, which indicate that could be a potential alternative as antimicrobial therapy of ExPEC infections. However, the antioxidant properties of these compounds make them very susceptible to degradation, thus reducing their pharmacological effectiveness. This study revealed that developed PNPs protect proanthocyanidins from oxidation and decrease the ability of ExPEC to invade epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner.

The technique was based on the photostimulation of Chlorin e6 encapsulated charge-conversion PNPs by a laser irradiation, which generates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequently killing of pathogenic bacteria under an acidic environment. This innovative technique was evaluated in both in vitro and in vivo models. Obtained results showed that PNPs are able to better recognise Gram-positive (

      Polymeric nanoparticles for neuroinfections

     <p id="Par85">
      Central nervous system (CNS) infections can be caused by different agents (e.g. viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi) and, in rare occasions, by prions infections. Meningitis and encephalitis are the most common neuroinfections in humans, which involve the inflammation of the whole brain of the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord, producing a high impact on tissue homeostasis [
      ]. There is a different etiological epidemiology of meningitis and encephalitis in different geographical regions; pathogens vary across different age groups, seasons and geographic locations. Viruses account for most cases of meningitis and encephalitis. Viral meningitis and encephalitis are usually benign and self-limiting, while bacterial meningitis and encephalitis can lead to disastrous damage [
      ]. The cardinal clinical symptoms and signs are mainly indistinguishable regardless of the inciting pathogen [
      ].

      CNS infections cause significant morbidity and mortality and often require neurosurgical intervention for proper diagnosis and treatment. Regarding to WHO, Africa had the highest pooled incidence of bacterial meningitis (65 cases/100,000 people) [
      ]. Approximately 304,000 meningitis patients and 77,000 encephalitis patients died all over the world in 2013 comparing to 46,4000 and 92,000 in 1990 respectively [

      One of the main limitations during bacterial neuroinfections treatment is the inability of antibiotics to surpass the BBB and the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), as well as the emerging of antibiotic resistance. To this end, drug targeting approaches are being recently used to overcome these issues [
      ]. Getting a local antimicrobial treatment, the concentration of the drug at the site of infection will be improved, as it may modulate drug-pathogen interaction to overcome antibiotic resistance, and enabling \drug-free\ anti-virulence therapy [
      ]. In this context, many studies have been conducted in order to improve antibacterial and antivirals compounds effectiveness by using of nanotechnology (Table

      The incidence of CNS bacterial infections is associated with the immunosuppressive drug treatments and increased prescription of antibiotics. Immunosuppression is usually followed by immunodeficiency disease, which led to those serious infections and, in case of CNS, BBB compromises the cumulative of antibacterial agents. In this context, Hong et al. developed a PEGylated-polymeric nanocarrier of bacitracin A coated with a specific brain-targeting peptide and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor against Pneumococcal meningitis (
      ). This study revealed the enhanced BBB-permeability attributed to the synergetic effect of both coating peptides. In vivo results further demonstrated that developed PNPs are able to accumulate in brain parenchyma and exhibit high therapeutic efficiency with negligible systemic toxicity compared to the free drug.

     Conclusions
    </title>
    <p id="Par90">
     The rise of the number of individuals affected by bacterial infectious diseases constitutes a significant socioeconomic health burden worldwide and is mainly related to economic and public health problems in developing countries, and nosocomial infections in developed countries. Even when promising therapeutic molecules are available, the appearance of MDR events has established itself as a serious public health problem worldwide. The widespread misuse of antibiotic drugs has promoted genetic mutations and smart evasion mechanisms by bacteria that have led to an important failure in these therapies. As reviewed herein, nanotechnologies applied to medicine—nanomedicine—have opened new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of bacterial infections. Specifically, state-of-the-art PNPs have demonstrated to possess optimal physicochemical characteristics to become a therapeutic revolution against human bacterial infections. This type of nanocarriers have shown to be safe, biodegradable, biocompatible, easily eliminated and non-toxic for the tissues and organs, offer many advantages for currently available molecules. Moreover, the targeting to a specific organ, the reduction of the adverse effects of many antibiotics, and prolonged accumulation over time in the infected area, altogether represent a breakthrough in this kind of therapy. Furthermore, polymers themselves have shown to be effective against multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria. Thus, the combination of loaded drugs together with polymeric matrices may offer a synergistic approach with innovative outputs and may represent the next step in the treatment of bacterial infections.
    </p>
    <p id="Par91">
     Research in the next few years will increasingly focus on the elucidating and better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of bacteria involved in MDR events to re-direct the drugs targets. Whilst PNPs are undoubtedly among the most efficient tools to overcome MDR bacteria problems, clinical translation of nanoparticles-based treatments remains a challenge for the pharmaceutical industry, since nanotechnology has not yet entered mainstream clinical practice. Stringent protocols of validation of in vitro and in vivo protocols are necessary to facilitate translation from bench to the clinical trials. Likewise, challenges for large scale manufacturing require innovation from chemists and engineers and regulatory policies have to be adapted to facilitate access to trials and patients. Thus, despite the huge progress in preclinical research, the translation of these drug delivery systems to clinical practice remains one of the most ambitious challenges in this field, and will be a major focus of most nanomedicine trials in the next decade.
    </p>
    <p id="Par92">
     Finally, the social gap between developed and developing countries, which is closely related to the rise of these diseases, is another of the important challenges that we face as a society. The development of a global community structure that ensures access to antibiotic drugs and their correct use, and effective public health measures will represent an advance against bacterial infections worldwide.
