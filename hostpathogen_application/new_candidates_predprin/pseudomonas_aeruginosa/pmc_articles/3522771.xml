We hypothesized that secreted effectors mediate translocon-independent intracellular replication. Translocon mutants of PAO1 lacking one or more of its three known effectors (ExoS, ExoT and ExoY) were used. All translocon mutants, irrespective of effectors expressed, localized to intracellular vacuoles. Translocon-effector null mutants and translocon-
