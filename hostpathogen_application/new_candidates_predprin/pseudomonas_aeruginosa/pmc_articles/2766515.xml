   utilizes a complex type III secretion apparatus to inject effector proteins into host cells. The configuration of this secretion machinery, the activities of the proteins that are injected by it, and the consequences of this process to infection are now being elucidated. This Review summarizes our current knowledge of

   type III secretion, including the secretion and translocation machinery, the regulation of this machinery, and the associated chaperones and effector proteins. The features of this interesting secretion system have important implications to the pathogenesis of
