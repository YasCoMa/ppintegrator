   The innate immune system encodes cytosolic Nod-like receptors (NLRs), several of which activate caspase 1 processing and IL-1β and IL-18 secretion. Macrophages respond to

    Salmonella typhimurium
   </italic>
   infection by activating caspase 1 through the NLR Ipaf. This activation is mediated by cytosolic flagellin through the activity of the virulence-associated type III secretion system (T3SS). We demonstrate here that

    Pseudomonas aeruginosa

   activates caspase 1 and induces IL-1β secretion in infected macrophages. While live, virulent

    P. aeruginosa

   activate IL-1β secretion through caspase 1 and Ipaf, strains that have mutations in the T3SS or in flagellin did not. Ipaf-dependent caspase 1 activation could be recapitulated by delivering

   flagellin to the macrophage cytosol. We examined the role of Naip5 in

   infection, as well as in response to cytosolic flagellin, but at slightly reduced levels. Thus, Ipaf-dependent detection of cytosolic flagellin is a conserved mechanism by which macrophages detect the presence of pathogens that use T3SS.
