  Lack of glucose phosphotransferase function in phosphofructokinase mutants of Escherichia coli.
 </title>
 <abstract>
  <p>
   Phosphofructokinase (pfkA) mutants of Escherichia coli are impaired in growth on all carbon sources entering glycolysis at or above the level of fructose 6-phosphate (nonpermissive carbon sources), but growth is particularly slow on sugars, such as glucose, which are normally transported and phosphorylated by the phosphoenolpyruvate, (PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS).
