   <bold>
    Background:
   </bold>
   The YvcK protein is essential for
   <italic>
    Bacillus subtilis
   </italic>
   growth on gluconeogenic conditions; its overproduction rescues an
   <italic>
    mreB
   </italic>
   mutant.
  </p>
  <p>
   <bold>
    Results:
   </bold>
   PrkC phosphorylates YvcK; this phosphorylation is not required for growth on gluconeogenic conditions but is necessary for
   <italic>
    mreB
   </italic>
   rescue.
  </p>
  <p>
   <bold>
    Conclusion:
   </bold>
   YvcK phosphorylation is specifically involved in
   <italic>
    B. subtilis
   </italic>
   morphogenesis.
  </p>
  <p>
   <bold>
    Significance:
   </bold>
   This phosphorylation-based regulatory mechanism could be widespread in bacteria.

  <p>
   The YvcK protein has been shown to be necessary for growth under gluconeogenic conditions in
   <italic>
    Bacillus subtilis.

   Amazingly, its overproduction rescues growth and morphology defects of the actin-like protein MreB deletion mutant by restoration of PBP1 localization. In this work, we observed that YvcK was phosphorylated at Thr-304 by the protein kinase PrkC and that phosphorylated YvcK was dephosphorylated by the cognate phosphatase PrpC. We show that neither substitution of this threonine with a constitutively phosphorylated mimicking glutamic acid residue or a phosphorylation-dead mimicking alanine residue nor deletion of
   <italic>
    prkC
   </italic>
   or
   <italic>
    prpC
   </italic>
   altered the ability of
   <italic>
    B. subtilis
   </italic>
   to grow under gluconeogenic conditions. However, we observed that a
   <italic>
    prpC
   </italic>
   mutant and a
   <italic>
    yvcK
   </italic>
   mutant were more sensitive to bacitracin compared with the WT strain. In addition, the bacitracin sensitivity of strains in which YvcK Thr-304 was replaced with either an alanine or a glutamic acid residue was also affected. We also analyzed rescue of the
   <italic>
    mreB
   </italic>
   mutant strain by overproduction of YvcK in which the phosphorylation site was substituted. We show that YvcK T304A overproduction did not rescue the
   <italic>
    mreB
   </italic>
   mutant aberrant morphology due to PBP1 mislocalization. The same observation was made in an
   <italic>
    mreB prkC
   </italic>
   double mutant overproducing YvcK. Altogether, these data show that YvcK may have two distinct functions: 1) in carbon source utilization independent of its phosphorylation level and 2) in cell wall biosynthesis and morphogenesis through its phosphorylation state.
