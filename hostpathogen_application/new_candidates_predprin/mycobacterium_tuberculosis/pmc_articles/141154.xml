  Direct Kinase-to-Kinase Signaling Mediated by the FHA Phosphoprotein Recognition Domain of the Dun1 DNA Damage Checkpoint Kinase
 </title>

   The serine-threonine kinase Dun1 contains a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain and functions in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway of

   phosphorylation by Rad53 does not require the Dun1 kinase activity and is likely to involve only a transient interaction between the two kinases. The checkpoint functions of Dun1 kinase in DNA damage-induced transcription, G

   /M cell cycle arrest, and Rad55 phosphorylation are severely compromised in an FHA domain mutant of Dun1. As a consequence, the Dun1 FHA domain mutant displays enhanced sensitivity to genotoxic stress induced by UV, methyl methanesulfonate, and the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea. We show that the Dun1 FHA domain is critical for direct kinase-to-kinase signaling from Rad53 to Dun1 in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway.
