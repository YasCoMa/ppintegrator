   complex (MTBC) representing the lineages 3, 4, 5 and 7 were characterized by mass spectrometry. A total of 2944 glycosylation events were discovered in 1325 proteins. This data set represents the highest number of glycosylated proteins identified in Mtb to date. O-glycosylation constituted 83% of the events identified, while 17% of the sites were N-glycosylated. This is the first report on N-linked protein glycosylation in Mtb and in Gram-positive bacteria. Collectively, the bulk of Mtb glycoproteins are involved in cell envelope biosynthesis, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, two-component systems, and pathogen-host interaction that are either surface exposed or located in the cell wall. Quantitative glycoproteomic analysis revealed that 101 sites on 67 proteins involved in Mtb fitness and survival were differentially glycosylated between the four lineages, among which 64% were cell envelope and membrane proteins. The differential glycosylation pattern may contribute to phenotypic variabilities across Mtb lineages. The study identified several clinically important membrane-associated glycolipoproteins that are relevant for diagnostics as well as for drug and vaccine discovery.

     Tuberculosis (TB) is a major threat to public health, causing more than three deaths per minute globally. The causative agent is

     complex (MTBC) to pave the way for the development of alternative TB control and prevention. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) including protein glycosylation are crucial in this regard. The unique Mtb glycoconjugates in the cell envelope are the predominant basis for host–pathogen interactions, antigenicity, and virulence determination and constitute one of the major components causing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Mtb
     . Glycosylation in Mtb has mainly been detected in surface-exposed proteins and in some other membrane proteins
     . The unique structure, antigenicity and essentiality of Mtb cell envelope glycoconjugates for mycobacterial growth provide opportunities for the development of novel drugs, vaccines, diagnostics and biomarkers
     .
    </p>
    <p id="Par3">
     Mtb glycoproteins play a critical role in a number of biological activities including cell adhesion and invasion, protein stability, localization, and maintenance of protein conformation
     . Other functions influenced by glycosylation are cellular signaling, AMR, immunomodulation, intracellular bacterial survival, biofilm formation, protein complex formation, antigenicity, pathogenicity and virulence
     . Recently, it has been shown that protein glycosylation was associated with low cell envelope permeability and AMR in the multi-resistant
     <italic>
      Mycobacterium abscessus
     </italic>
     . Furthermore, glycosylation protects proteolytically-sensitive cleavage sites, thereby maintaining the membrane-association of the protein by its lipid anchor, and may also be linked to protein export
     .
    </p>
    <p id="Par4">
     The Mtb cell envelope is composed of an inner plasma membrane, a cell wall core with an outer mycomembrane, and an outermost layer, known as the capsule composed of polysaccharides, lipids and proteins
     . The cell wall core is composed of peptidoglycan (PG) covalently linked via phosphoryl-N-acetylglucosaminosylrhamnosyl to arabinogalactan (AG), which in turn is esterified to α-alkyl, β-hydroxy long-chain mycolic acids, forming the mycolyl arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (mAGP) complex
     . This complex is essential for bacterial viability and is the basis of susceptibility and resistance to many anti-TB drugs including ethambutol (EMB) and ethionamide (ETH)
     . Mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (LAM), one of the key Mtb virulence factors, is a surface-exposed lipoglycan anchored to the inner and outer membranes via a mannosyl phosphate inositol
     . The soluble components of the cell envelope include free lipids, proteins, LAM, and phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), which are signaling effector molecules in bacterial pathogenesis and disease processes
     . The nature and amounts of the mycomembrane and capsular material vary among Mtb isolates and is likely to impact significantly on the pathogen phenotype and outcome of the pathogen-host interaction
     .
    </p>
    <p id="Par5">
     PG is a polymer of alternating N-acylated muramic acid (MurNac) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) residues linked in a β (1 → 4) configuration with cross-linked peptides of varying composition attached to the muramyl moieties
     . PG glycosyltransferases use the lipid-linked donor precursor for the synthesis of oligo-β-(1 → 4)-[GlcNAc-β-(1 → 4)-MurNAc(peptide)] glycan strands
     . In contrast to most other bacteria, muramic acid moieties are N-glycolylated (oxidized) in mycobacteria
     . In Mtb, MurNGly, MurNAc and Mur residues are present in the precursor pool and in the PG

     The membrane-bound glycosyltransferases or oligosaccharyltransferases (OSTs) catalyze the transfer of the monosaccharide moiety of an activated nucleotide-sugar substrate from lipid carriers to acceptor substrates, such as monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins, lipids, small organic molecules, and DNA, and hence produce a wide variety of biomolecules
     . Glycosidases are enzymes involved in both the degradation of glycans and the removal of monosaccharides to form intermediates that are acted upon by glycosyltransferases for the biosynthesis of glycans
     .

     have well-characterized bacterial N-linked and O-linked glycosylation systems, respectively
     . In N-linked protein glycosylation, an oligosaccharide is transferred by N-OST from a lipid donor to asparagines (N) located within the well-recognized consensus sequence D/E-Y-N-X-S/T and N-X-S/T (Y≠P, X≠P) of proteins
     . Bacterial O-OSTs are responsible for the reversible attachment of glycans to hydroxyl groups of serine (S), threonine (T) and tyrosine (Y) residues, with no apparent sequence specificity
     .

     Glycoproteomics is likely to identify Mtb virulence factors because glycoproteins on the bacterial cell envelope are used by mycobacteria to enable their entry into the primary human host cell, the macrophage
     . It has been proposed that Mtb interacts with mannose receptors (MRs) on host cells via mannosylated proteins to enter the macrophages
     . Despite the vital importance of these proteins in Mtb pathogenesis, our current knowledge of Mtb glycoproteins is still limited, and only a few secreted and cell wall-associated glycoproteins have been described to date
     . Previous studies have used laboratory strains as model systems to study glycosylation in Mtb. However, only a few sub-groups within the genetically conserved MTBC appear to cause extensive outbreaks with different clinical presentation and AMR
     . In this study, we employed qualitative and quantitative mass spectrometry and bioinformatics to explore the glycoproteomic patterns of clinical isolates from four lineages of the MTBC, lineages 3, 4, 5 and 7, to investigate the role of protein glycosylation in Mtb adaptation, survival and AMR.

     Our study reveals the presence of a number of glycoproteins that play roles in MTBC virulence and pathogenesis. These include proteins involved in pathogen-host interaction, transport and biosynthesis of MTBC cell envelope components, and drug efflux pumps, which are attractive pharmacological targets. Furthermore, we found quantitative differences in glycosylation patterns among the different lineages of MTBC that may potentially contribute to explaining their phenotypic characteristics.

      After filtering the data for potential contaminants and hits to the reverse database, the peptide intensities were log2-transformed. For protein identification, the data was further filtered using localization probability of 0.7, PEP of 0.05 and having valid values in at least one sample resulted in 2944 class-I glycosylation events derived from 1325 unique proteins in MTBC strains representing lineages 3, 4, 5 and 7. The term “glycosylation event” is used to avoid confusion when a single glycosylation site is glycosylated by more than one type of glycan residues. O-glycosylation constituted 2455 (83%) of the events identified (1311 events at T and 1144 events at S residues) and the remaining 489 sites (17%) were glycosylated at N residues (Fig.
      , Supplementary Table
      ). Comparative glycoproteomic analysis among the four MTBC lineages revealed that 945 (32.1%) of the total glycosylation events identified were shared amongst the four lineages (Fig.
      ). Comparison at the level of unique glycoproteins revealed that 44.2% of the glycoproteins were shared among the four lineages, irrespective of the glycosylation site and glycan residues (Fig.

Among the 2944 glycosylation events detected, 1010 had valid values in at least six valid LFQ intensity values from the total of 12 biological replicates (50%) and were thus subjected to further quantitative analysis. The missing values were imputed from the normal distribution and the log2-transformed data was normalized to Z-scores for further statistical testing. Multiple sample test analysis at a P &lt; 0.05 level of significance revealed that 101 sites on 67 proteins were differentially glycosylated (differential abundance of a peptide/protein glycosylated at a specific site) between the four MTBC lineages studied (Fig.

These proteins belonged to different functional categories including lipid metabolism, cell wall and cell processes, virulence, detoxification and adaptation, and hypothetical proteins (Supplementary Table

Clinically important differentially glycosylated proteins include the lipoarabinomannan carrier protein LprG, chaperone proteins GroEL1, class A β-lactamases BlaC, mammalian cell entry (Mce)-family protein Mce2D, peroxidase BpoB, penicillin-binding glycoprotein PbpB, and a number of proteins involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism (Supplementary Table

      In the hierarchical clustering of the differentially glycosylated proteins, the modern lineages (lineage 3 and lineage 4 strains) clustered together, separated from the ancient lineages (lineage 5 and lineage 7 strains) (Fig.

The first cluster included 14 hyper-glycosylated proteins (having a significantly higher number of glycosylation events at a specific position in a protein than the average) in lineage 3 and lineage 4 strains, encompassing LppW (S67, N69, T77), UvrA (T628, N636), PurK (S204), PPE42 (S12), FadE35 (S106, S110), LdtA (T147, S151, S156), DsbF (T47), NarL (S113, T114) and Rv3483c (T77, S78) (Fig.

Virulence factors such as PbpB (S83), GroeL1 (T141, T148, S150, S151), VapC10 (S6), VapB11 (S7) and the transcriptional regulatory protein Rv0818 (S65) were hyper-glycosylated in lineage 4 strains. The alanine rich protein Rv3863 (S11), the transmembrane ATP-binding protein ABC transporter protein Rv2326c and a polyketide synthase involved in sidrophore biosynthesis MbtD (T591) were hyper-glycosylated in lineage 5 strains (Supplementary Table

     Discussion
    </title>
    <p id="Par23">
     Our analysis identified with high confidence a total of 2944 glycosylation events on 1325 Mtb unique proteins. To our knowledge, the discovery of such a large number of glycosylation sites in these four clinical strains from different MTBC lineages is unprecedented. About 83.4% of the glycosylation events were localized on S and T residues, indicating a possible interplay with phosphorylation. It has been reported that different glycosylation events may occur on the same S and T residues of the protein or competitively at adjacent or residues in close proximity, and hence potentially allow control of cellular signaling
     . The study provides the first evidence on N-linked protein glycosylation in Mtb and Gram-positive bacteria. Protein glycosylation occurred at numerous sites on surface-exposed proteins with no apparent amino acid sequence specificity (Fig.
     )
     . As previously reported, there is a relatively high propensity for R, A, P, L, G, V, S and T flanking the modified sites in a significant portion of the glycosylation sites mapped
     (Fig.
     ). However, a number of suggested signature motifs were identified in nearly 17% of the events and R was enriched between the −8 and +8 positions in contrast to the D/E-Y-N-X-S/T (Y, X #P) motif proposed for N-glycosylation
     . This difference might partly be due to the diversity of the glycan residues analyzed and the high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates in the glycosyltransferases
     . Comparative analysis revealed that only 32.1% of the glycosylation events and 44.2% of the glycoproteins were shared among the four lineages. The higher versatility at the level of PTMs may indicate the power of PTMs in explaining the phenotypic variability among MTBC than the proteomic studies.

     DeoxyHex was the most frequently identified glycan residue in our search, followed by Hept, pent, Hex, HexN, HexNac/GlcNac, MurNGly and MurNac (Supplementary Table
     ). In bacteria, 6-deoxy-hexoses, like fucose and rhamnose, are important components of cell surface glycans
     . The pentose sugars arabinose and galactose are components of the heteropolysaccharide, AG, which serves to connect PG with the outer mycolic acid layer
     . Bacterial heptosyltransferases are reported to be involved in O-glycosylation of autotransporters using ADP-heptose
     . The presence of frequently occurring glycan residues attached to lipoproteins, extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs) and glycoproteins might alter the structure and function of these biomolecules in particular and bacterial physiology in general
     . We identified both ADP- and UDP linked to different sugar molecules to form an activated nucleotide-sugar substrates for OST (Supplementary Tables
     and
     ). Most publications reported that only UDP-linked sugars were the substrates for OST
     , while other reports showed that a particular OST, heptosyltransferase, used ADP-heptose as an activated nucleotide-sugar substrate

     The outermost layer of the Mtb cell envelope is a major determinant of virulence and pathogenicity, and is mainly composed of proteins, polysaccharides and small amount of lipids
     . It acts as a permeability barrier of the cell envelope, promoting the phagocytosis of Mtb
     , maintaining cell integrity, regulating phagosome maturation
     and playing diverse roles in the pathogen-host interactions
     . The gene ontology analysis showed that the majority of the glycoproteins identified were localized in the cell wall and plasma membrane while lipid homeostasis, fatty acid metabolism, and response to the host immune response were among the biological processes enriched. Besides, the PPI network analysis showed that most of these cell-envelope associated glycoproteins are involved in pathogen-host interaction and fatty acid/lipid metabolism. These cell envelope-associated glycoproteins have been shown to have a vital role in Mtb virulence and pathogenesis (reviewed in
     ).

     Lipoproteins were amongst the highly glycosylated Mtb proteins identified in this study. Lipoproteins are a functionally diverse class of membrane-bound proteins involved in colonization, invasion, evasion of host defence and immunomodulation, cell envelope biogenesis, transport across the membrane, nutrient acquisition, adhesion, cell invasion and initiation of inflammatory processes (Table
     )
     . The lipoprotein LpqH was the most densely glycosylated lipoprotein detected, with 33 N-terminally clustered O-glycosylation events, where all glycan residues were hexoses (Supplementary Table
     ). Notably, these sites were densely located between residues 27–48 within the 159 amino acid protein. Some of the glycosylation sites have previously been reported as part of the MR binding domain of LpqH, as shown in the 3D model (Fig.
     )
     . Three of the sites, T41, S43 and S48, were part of a mature protein fragment (residues 41–60) that was reported to prevent uptake of Mtb by macrophage-like U937 cells
     . Altering the glycosylated Ser residues in LpqH have been shown to affect binding affinity and exposure to proteolytic cleavage
     . LpqH, an immunodominant TLR2 agonist, is crucial for Mtb growth and multiplication in IFN-γ-activated macrophages as well as in IFN-γ-deficient mice
     . Mannosylated LpqH is the major adhesin for the macrophage MR and DC-SIGN, and the mannose residue serves as an adhesin for binding to the host MR

     A number of other clinically important glycoproteins were identified. The cell surface glycoprotein Apa binds to DC-SIGN and surfactant protein, facilitates colonization and invasion of host cells
     . Changes in the glycosylation pattern of Apa lead to a reduced stimulatory T-lymphocyte response, exhibiting the biological role of the glycan moiety
     . Glycosylation is also required for proper localization of superoxide dismutases (SodB)
     . The immunogenic glycoproteins MPT64 and Apa are virulence factors involved in Mtb infection of human cells and is a promising candidate for a subunit-based anti-TB vaccine
     . Heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HbhA) glycoprotein mediates adherence to epithelial cells and is required for extrapulmonary dissemination of Mtb
     . The lipoprotein LprG is another glycolipoprotein that blocks host cell phagosome-lysosome fusion, and is required for full Mtb virulence
     .

     Glycoproteins associated with drug efflux pumps, drug-hydrolyzing enzymes, or capable of altering Mtb cell wall permeability mediates the development of AMR (reviewed in
     ). These include proteins like the mycobacterial membrane protein large (MmpL) proteins, daunorubicin-dim-transport integral membrane protein ABC transporter (DrrC), class a beta-lactamase (BlaC) and LprG (Table
     ). DrrC, Rv0194, Rv2994, Rv1273c and a number of MmpL glycoproteins are efflux pumps for anti-TB drugs, contributing to AMR
     . In addition to a role in drug resistance, MmpLs are involved in the export of cell wall associated lipids and siderophores, and are attractive pharmacological targets
     . BlaC hydrolyzes nitrocefin and other β-lactams, thereby increasing Mtb resistance towards different classes of β-lactam antibiotics
     . LprG controls cell wall permeability and efflux of drugs, and therefore plays a role in Mtb susceptibility to first-line anti-TB drugs

     The study identified a number of membrane-associated glycoproteins involved in cell envelope biosynthesis and drug efflux pumps, which are potential Mtb drug targets (Table
     , Fig.
     ). AcpM was second most densely glycosylated protein involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis, one of the major components of the Mtb cell wall. Glycosylation sites Ser41, Ser43 and Thr51 were detected within the AcpM CP domain profile. Importantly, one of the glycosylation sites identified (Ser41) is the binding site for 4′-phosphopantetheine, an activator of AcpM
     . Other glycoproteins involved in mycolic acid synthesis include MmaA1, MmaA2, MmaA3 and PcaA, Pks13, KasA, KasB and FabG1. Bacilli lacking all mycolic acid methyltransferases are viable but highly attenuated and hyperinflammatory in mice
     . Pks13 catalyzes the last condensation step of mycolic acid biosynthesis and is essential for the mycobacterial survival
     . Glycoproteins FbpB (Ag85B) and FbpC (Ag85c) also possess a mycolyltransferase activity
     . These glycoproteins help to maintain the Mtb cell wall integrity by catalyzing the transfer of mycolic acids to cell wall AG, and through the synthesis of the virulence factor cord factor (trehalose 6,6′-dimycolate, TDM)
     . Furthermore, FbpB and FbpC are T- and B-cell antigens and may have an application in sero-diagnostics

     . A number of glycosylated fatty acyl-AMP ligases that have been shown to play a role in cell wall biosynthesis, production of complex lipids and growth
     were identified. As discussed above, glycosylation is involved in regulating the activity of different enzymes. In this study, identification of glycosylated glycosyltransferases (with rare abundance) may play a role in regulating its function as an enzyme

     Twenty glycosylation events on proteins belonging to the specialized ESX secretion system components, including the crucial T-cell antigen ESAT-6, were detected. The ESX secretion system is essential for full Mtb virulence (ESX-1) and physiological processes (ESX-3)
     . Five proteins involved in the general secretion (Sec) pathway and a twin-arginine translocation pathways (TatB) were also found to be glycosylated. These specific proteins are essential for bulk export of proteins in Mtb
     . CpnT, the first autotransporter-like protein to be identified in Mtb, was glycosylated at a domain that is required for the membrane localization of this protein
     . Our former study showed that glycoproteins including LpqH, AcpM, GroEL1, GroEL2, DnaK, Pks13, KatG, LprK, SecA1 and a number of proteins involved in lipid metabolism and protein synthesis were highly acetylated in Mtb

     A recent report demonstrated a mechanism for co-regulation of Mtb cell wall synthesis and ribosome maturation (protein synthesis), and hence glycosylation of proteins involved in these two processes (Fig.

     culture may only reflect the mycobacterial phenotype in the absence of stress, which may not completely if at all overlap patterns during infection. So, further mapping the exclusive presence and/or differential abundance of Mtb glycoproteins naturally or during exposure to environmental stress or infection may contribute to elucidate the selective advantages and survival strategies adopted by a specific pathogen. This information is fundamental for any drug or vaccine discovery process
     . More than 64% of the differentially glycosylated proteins were found to be cell envelope-associated proteins. These glycoproteins are reported to be involved in Mtb virulence and pathogenesis (reviewed in
     ). The hierarchical clustering of the differentially glycosylated proteins coincided with the phylogeny among the MTBC, where the modern lineages (lineage 3 and lineage 4 strains) clustered together, separated from the ancient lineages (lineage 5 and lineage 7 strains) (Fig.

     Clinically important proteins such as FadE35, LppW, LdtA, PurK, PPE42 and UvrA were hyper-glycosylated in lineage 3 and lineage 4 strains compared to the ancient lineages

     . The antigen PPE42 is known to elicit humoral immune response against Mtb
     . Glycoproteins including LprG, Mce2D, DagK, UvrC and VapC45 were hyper-glycosylated in all lineages except lineage 7 strains. LprG plays a role in transport and localization of the TLR2 agonists, LAM, PIM, LM and triacylglycerides to the cell surface, maintaining cell envelope integrity, and inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion, thereby enhancing Mtb survival inside macrophages
     . The DagK is involved in the biosynthesis of Mtb virulence factors PI and PIMs
     . The membrane proteins DsbF and Rv0412c, iron-sulfur cluster carrier protein Mrp, ATPase MoxR3 and PknA were hyper-glycosylated in lineage 5 and lineage 7 strains. A number of proteins involved in lipid metabolism such as FadD9, FadD34, and PG synthesis like DacB1, and oxidoreductases BpoB and Rv2766c, were hyper-glycosylated in lineage 7 strains. Four glycosylation sites on GroeL1, a chaperone involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis during biofilm formation
     , were uniformly hyper-glycosylated in lineage 4 strains. Penicillin-binding membrane protein PbpB, another hyper-glycosylated lineage 4 strains, is an essential enzyme involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis and has been predicted to be an important drug target
     . These proteins are essential virulence factors used by Mtb for cell wall biosynthesis, stress response, immunomodulation, efficient host cell invasion, survival, growth and other physiological processes
     . The relative abundance of these essential glycoproteins across the different lineages of Mtb might lead to a specific phenotype with better adaptability to the host.

     Identification of glycoproteins and their function contributes to a better understanding of the pathogenesis and survival strategies adopted by Mtb. This knowledge is fundamental for diagnostic, drug or vaccine discovery process. Many anti-TB drugs target the biosynthesis of PG, MA and AG, drug efflux pumps and other virulence factors used by Mtb to efficiently invade and multiply inside the host
     . Our study has identified a large number of membrane-associated glycolipoproteins involved in Mtb pathogenesis. We present a comprehensive glycoproteome map of Mtb and show that there are significant quantitative differences across the various Mtb lineages that may directly influence phenotype. Further purification and detailed functional studies addressing selected uncharacterized glycoproteins may reveal the physiological role of protein glycosylation in defining the phenotype of a bacillus. These findings expand the current understanding of the nature and diversity of Mtb glycoproteins, open a new avenue of research for identification of potential drug targets, and create opportunities to engineer glycoproteins for their clinical applications
