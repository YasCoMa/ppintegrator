3015060	body	whereas no mammalian partner was thus far associated with the pdz - binding motif of nleh1 , a previous report demonstrated that espi binds a number of pdz - containing proteins , including nherf1 and nherf2 ( ) .	bind|bind	2		0	was|espi|mammalian|partner|nleh1|pdz|-|containing|proteins|nherf1|nherf2	11
3015060	body	overlaying a fusion consisting of the last 150 amino acids of nleh1 and gst ( gst - nleh1c150 ) ( a gst - nleh1c50 fusion was unstable ) on the pdz - domain protein array revealed that nleh1 bound pdz2 of nherf2 , although this interaction appeared weaker than either map : nherf2 or espi : nherf2 ( ) ( ) .	interact	1		0	was|espi|last|150|amino|acids|nleh1|gst|pdz|pdz2|nherf2|map	12
