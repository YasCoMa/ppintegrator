7064604	abstract	this was followed by identification of the probable inhibitors of ptka using drug repurposing to block the ptpa - ptka interaction .	block|interact	2		0	ptka|ptpa	2
5760654	body	the interaction between ptka and trxb2 was found to be similar to that of ptka and ptpa , based on comparable m. smegamatis growth in the presence of trimethoprim .	interact	1		0	ptka|ptpa	2
5760654	body	while the exact mechanism of this upregulation was not identified and may be a result of increased expression of ptpa and / or rv2235 as complementation of the ptka mutant did not restore wt levels , we found that ptka is able to bind and phosphorylate trxb2 on tyrosine .	bind	1		0	ptpa|ptka|mutant|trxb2	4
5760654	body	the blots were blocked with 2 % milk proteins in tbs - t and probed with affinity purified rabbit polyclonal ( yenzym antibodies , llc ) anti - ptka ( 1:50000 ) , anti - ptpa ( 1:500 ) , anti - trxb2 ( 1:50000 ) , or anti - dosr ( 1:2500 ) and incubated overnight at 4 Â°c .	block	1		0	ptka|ptpa|tbs|yenzym|antibodies|dosr	6
8289223	body	individual knock - out mutants of ptpa [ 47 ] and ptka [ 51 ] both show impaired intracellular survival indicating that these signalling proteins are independently important for mtb pathogenicity .	impair	1		0	ptpa|ptka|signalling|proteins|mtb	5
