  Mechanisms used by virulent

   Innate and adaptive immunity are inter-related by dendritic cells (DCs), which directly recognize bacteria through the binding of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to specialized receptors on their surface. After capturing and degrading bacteria, DCs present their antigens as small peptides bound to MHC molecules and prime naive bacteria-specific T cells. In response to PAMP recognition DCs undergo maturation, which is a phenotypic change that increases their immunogenicity and promotes the activation of naive T cells. As a result, a specific immune response that targets bacteria-derived antigens is initiated. Therefore, the characterization of DCâ€“bacteria interactions is important to understand the mechanisms used by virulent bacteria to avoid adaptive immunity. Furthermore, any impairment of DC function might contribute to bacterial survival and dissemination inside the host. An example of a bacterial pathogen capable of interfering with DC function is
