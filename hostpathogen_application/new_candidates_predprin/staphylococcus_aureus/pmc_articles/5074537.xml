   Salmonellae invasion and intracellular replication within host cells results in a range of diseases including gastroenteritis, bacteraemia, enteric fever and focal infections. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which Salmonellae alter host cell physiology through the delivery of effector proteins with specific activities, and through the modulation of defence and stress response pathways in the host. In this Review, we summarize our current knowledge of the complex interplay of bacterial and host factors that lead to inflammation, disease and in most cases, control of Salmonellae infection, particularly

   serovar Typhimurium, by its animal hosts. We also highlight gaps in our knowledge of the contributions of Salmonellae and the host to disease pathogenesis and suggest future avenues for further study.

   In this Review, Miller and colleagues discuss the arsenal of effector proteins that salmonellae use to manipulate their animal hosts, in addition to the host response to these infections. The authors also discuss the challenges ahead for unravelling the mechanistic details of effector function.
