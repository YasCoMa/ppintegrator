   Binding of alpha/beta-type small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP) is the major determinant of DNA resistance to damage caused by UV radiation, heat, and oxidizing agents in spores of Bacillus and Clostridium species. Analysis of several alpha/beta-type SASP showed that these proteins have essentially no secondary structure in the absence of DNA, but become significantly alpha-helical upon binding to double-stranded DNAs or oligonucleotides. Folding of alpha/beta-type SASP induced by a variety of DNAs and oligonucleotides was measured by CD spectroscopy, and this allowed determination of a DNA binding site size of 4 base pairs as well as equilibrium binding parameters of the alpha/beta-type SASP-DNA interaction. Analysis of the equilibrium binding data further allowed determination of both intrinsic binding constants (K) and cooperativity factors (omega), as the alpha/beta-type SASP-DNA interaction was significantly cooperative, with the degree of cooperativity depending on both the bound DNA and the salt concentration. Kinetic analysis of the interaction of one alpha/beta-type SASP, SspC(Tyr), with DNA indicated that each binding event involves the dimerization of SspC(Tyr) monomers at a DNA binding site. The implications of these findings for the structure of the alpha/beta-type SASP.DNA complex and the physiology of alpha/beta-type SASP degradation during spore germination are discussed.
