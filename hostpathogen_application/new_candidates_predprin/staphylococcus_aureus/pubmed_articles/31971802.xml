  <AbstractText>
   Herein, we report a one-pot process that marries mechanistically distinct, traditional cross-coupling reactions with C-H functionalization using the same precatalyst. The reactions proceed in yields of up to 95%, in air, and require no extraneous ligand. The reactions are thought to be facilitated by harnessing the substrate quinoline as an

   -ligand, and evidence of the palladium-quinoline interaction is provided by   H-   N HMBC NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallographic structures. Application of the methodology is demonstrated by the quick formation of fluorescent, Ï€-extended frameworks.
