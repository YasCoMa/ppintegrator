   Staphostatins, a novel family of cysteine protease inhibitors with a unique mechanism of action and distinct protein fold has recently been discovered. In this report we describe the properties of Staphylococcus epidermidis staphostatin A (EcpB), a new member of the family. As for other staphostatins, the recombinant S. epidermidis staphostatin A exerted very narrow inhibitory specificity, limited to cysteine protease from the same species. The closely related proteases from S. aureus cleaved the inhibitor at the reactive site peptide bond and inactivated it. The EcpB homologue, S. aureus staphostatin A (ScpB), was also susceptible to proteolytic cleavage at the same site by non-target cysteine proteases. Conversely, S. aureus staphostatin B (SspC) was resistant to such proteolysis. The difference in the susceptibility of individual inhibitors to proteolytic cleavage at the reactive site suggests subtle variations in the mechanism of interaction with cysteine proteases.
