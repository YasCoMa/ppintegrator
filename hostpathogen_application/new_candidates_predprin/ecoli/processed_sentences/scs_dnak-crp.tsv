3938503	body	a careful observation demonstrates that crp - 2 is located 127bp upstream to sigh - binding site which is positioned between –158 to –130 from translation stop codon ( 5 -  gggaacaagacccgcacgaccagcgtta - 3 ) , whereas crp - 1 overlaps with sigh - recognition sequence in 5 - utr of dnak ( fig .	bind	1		0	crp|dnak|-|2|sigh|gggaacaagacccgcacgaccagcgtta|3	7

3938503	body	these results thus establish that : i ) regulation of dnak expression is governed by direct binding of crpm to its 5 - utr , ii ) crpm binds at crp - 2 site and not at crp - 1 site in the dnak promoter , and iii ) binding of crpm to 5 - utr of dnak and its subsequent effect on mrna expression is independent of sigh binding .	bind|bind|bind|bind	4		0	dnak|crpm|crp|sigh	4
