6304983	abstract	we demonstrate that mycoplasma dnak interacts with and reduces the activities of human proteins involved in critical cellular pathways , including dna - pk and parp1 , which are required for efficient dna repair , and binds to usp10 ( a key p53 regulator ) , impairing p53 - dependent anticancer functions .	interact|bind|impair	3		0	dnak|parp1|mycoplasma|human|proteins|pk|usp10|p53|regulator	9
6304983	body	the interaction of dnak with two proteins important for the recognition of dna damage and repair , resulting in decreased parp1 catalytic activity , would likely lead to apoptosis or to the accumulation of dna damage , thereby increasing the probability of cellular transformation ( ) .	interact	1		0	dnak|parp1	2
6304983	body	we show here that dnak , a bacterial chaperone protein belonging to the hsp70 family , interacts with several human proteins , namely usp10 , parp1 , and dna - pk cs , involved in important cellular pathways .	interact	1		0	dnak|parp1|bacterial|chaperone|protein|hsp70|family|human|proteins|usp10|pk|cs	12
6304983	body	based on our data , we hypothesize that the presence of bacterial dnak protein inside the cell , interacting and hampering the function of cellular proteins critical for an effective dna repair ( parp1 and dna - pk c ) , could lead to the accumulation of dna damage .	interact	1		0	dnak|parp1|bacterial|protein|cellular|proteins|pk|c	8
8069837	abstract	we previously isolated and characterized in our laboratory a strain of human mycoplasma m. fermentans subtype incognitus ( mf - i1 ) able to induce lymphoma in a severe combined immuno - deficient ( scid ) mouse model , and we demonstrated that its chaperone protein , dnak , binds and reduces functions of human poly - adp ribose polymerase - 1 ( parp1 ) and ubiquitin carboxyl - terminal hydrolase protein - 10 ( usp10 ) , which are required for efficient dna repair and proper p53 activities , respectively .	bind	1		0	dnak|parp1|chaperone|protein|human|poly|-|adp|ribose|polymerase|ubiquitin|carboxyl|terminal|hydrolase|usp10	15
8069837	body	we previously demonstrated that dnak from a strain of m. fermentans subtype incognitus isolated in our laboratory ( mf - i1 ) from an hiv patient binds to human proteins poly ( adp - ribose ) polymerase 1 ( parp1 ) , central for sensing dna damage and initiating repair activities , and ubiquitin carboxyl - terminal hydrolase 10 ( usp10 ) [ ] , which promotes activity and stabilization of p53 , critical for its anti - cancer functions [ ] .	bind	1		0	dnak|parp1|i1|ubiquitin|usp10|p53	6
8069837	body	we previously demonstrated that a chaperone protein , dnak , from a m. fermentans subtype incognitus ( mf - i1 ) isolated in our laboratory , binds and reduces functions of human poly - adp ribose polymerase - 1 ( parp1 ) and ubiquitin carboxyl - terminal hydrolase protein - 10 ( usp10 ) , which are required for efficient dna repair and proper p53 activities , respectively .	bind	1		0	dnak|parp1|chaperone|protein|human|poly|-|adp|ribose|polymerase|ubiquitin|carboxyl|terminal|hydrolase|usp10	15
7565387	body	we showed that the binding of dnak to parp1 , which recognizes dna breaks and participates in dna repair [ , , , ] , reduces its activity and , following recognition of damaged dna , parylation of certain proteins of very high mw is greatly reduced ( & gt ; 150 kda ) , while it seems it only marginally affects proteins between 100â€“150 kda [ , ] .	bind	1		0	dnak|parp1|&|gt|;|150|kda	7
9051441	body	once in the cell , dnak interacts with several host proteins , including those involved in dna repair , like parp1 ( poly - adp ribose polymerase - 1 ) and usp10 ( ubiquitin carboxyl - terminal hydrolase protein - 10 ) .	interact	1		0	dnak|parp1|host|proteins|adp|ribose|polymerase|usp10|ubiquitin|carboxyl|-|terminal|hydrolase|protein	14
