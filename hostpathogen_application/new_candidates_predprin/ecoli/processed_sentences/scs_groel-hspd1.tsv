7814154	body	in contrast to groel , hspd1 shows less requirement for inter - ring cooperativity , and hspd1 mutants with impaired double ring formation can remain fully functional .	impair	1		0	groel|hspd1|mutants	3
7814154	body	the recently published structures of the adp - bef3 - bound football complex and the adp - bound football and half - football complexes represent a large step toward understanding the differences and similarities between groel -  and hspd1 - catalyzed protein folding ( gomez - llorente et al. , 2020 ) .	complex|complex	2		0	groel|hspd1|adp|bef3|football|complex|complexes|catalyzed|protein	9
7814154	body	the reconstruction showed no significant anisotropy , and the resolution was sufficient to enable atomic modeling based on previous apo - groel and the hspd1 - hspe1 complex crystal structures ( figure 2 and table 1 ) .figure 2cryo - em structure of hspd1 single ring ( a ) raw micrograph of apo hspd1 ( scale bar , 50 nm ) .	complex	1		0	groel|hspd1|hspe1|complex|table|1	6
7814154	body	conformational variability of hspd1 subunits within the complex apart from the differences in complex stoichiometry ( single ring ) the structures of apo hspd1 and groel ( pdb : 1xck , bartolucci et al. , 2005 ) are highly similar on the subunit level , as expected with 51 % sequence identity .	subunit|complex|complex|subunit	4		0	hspd1|groel|subunits	3
7814154	body	this shows that hspd1 subunits can adopt a range of conformations , some of which are very similar to groel , but that more extended forms of hspd1 are preferred .	subunit	1		0	hspd1|groel|subunits	3

7814154	body	compared with groel or double ring structures of the hspd1 / e1 complex , the inverted double ring of hspd1 requires each ring to be rotated by 180Â° perpendicular to their 7 - fold symmetry axes ( figure 5d ) .	complex	1		0	groel|hspd1|e1|complex	4
7814154	body	although significant strides in our understanding of chaperones have been achieved through studies of the bacterial groel complex , this work provides new insights into the human hspd1 chaperone and highlights that direct study of this system is key if we are to design specific modulators of function that can provide potent new therapeutics .	complex	1		0	groel|hspd1|bacterial|complex	4
