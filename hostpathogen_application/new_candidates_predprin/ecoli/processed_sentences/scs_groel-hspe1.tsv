7814154	body	the reconstruction showed no significant anisotropy , and the resolution was sufficient to enable atomic modeling based on previous apo - groel and the hspd1 - hspe1 complex crystal structures ( and ) .	complex	1		0	groel|hspe1|hspd1|complex	4
7814154	body	relative to the half - football , the apical domains of apo hspd1 undergo a large rigid body motion , resulting in an overall ~66Â° rotation ( a ) , which is comparable to structural changes in groel between adp / groes - bound and  - unbound states and required to allow hspe1 binding in the half - football state .	bind	1		0	groel|hspe1|apical|domains|apo|hspd1|adp|groes	8

6022707	body	the members of this group can be divided into three distinct subgroups : type i chaperonins , established by hspe1 and hspd1 genes ( also known by their bacterial names groes and groel or hsp10 and hsp60 respectively ) , type ii chaperonins forming the t - complex protein - 1 ring complex ( tric ) which is formed by a double ring structure with eight distinct subunits ( tcp1 and cct genes ) working as an atp dependent protein folding machinery [ ] , and finally the bbs group of genes ( bbs10 , bbs12 and mkks ) that in conjunction with the tric complex mediate the bbsome assembly [ ] .	complex|complex|subunit|complex	4		0	hspe1|groel|type|i|chaperonins|hsp10|hsp60|ii|t|-|complex|protein|tcp1|mkks|tric	15
