5803255	body	ahr binding motifs , tgcgtg , were present most frequently within shp binding peak regions in 1c genes , including pemt , gnmt , ahcyl2 , mtr , and mthfr , although binding sites for other factors , such as srebp - 1 and creb , were also detected in some of these genes ( fig .	bind|bind|bind	3		0	ahr|creb|binding|motifs|tgcgtg|ahcyl2|mtr|srebp	8
6163841	body	nrs have been shown to trigger ( 1 ) the phosphorylation of the creb ( camp - responsive element binding protein ) protein which associates with the ahr on its target promoters ( including that of cyp1a1 ) , and ( 2 ) the activity of the ca2+ / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase iv ( camk - iv ) , which can modulate the ahr function [ 124 ] .	bind	1		0	creb|ahr|nrs|(|camp|-|responsive|element|binding|protein|)|cyp1a1|calmodulin|camk|iv	15
7287590	body	the study also proposes two mechanism models that may explain their mutual repression following their interaction ; which are , the formation of an inactive complex or regulation by the transcription mediator p300 / creb - binding protein ( cbp ) that leads to competitive binding between ligand - ahr / arnt complexes and rela for p300 / cbp [ 149 ] .	interact|complex|bind|bind|ligand|complex	6		0	creb|ahr|inactive|complex|p300|cbp|arnt|complexes|rela	9
