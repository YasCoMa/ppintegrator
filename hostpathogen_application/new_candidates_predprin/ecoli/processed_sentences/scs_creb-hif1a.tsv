8535959	body	evaluation of key transcription factors in pig fut3 core promoter to further identify the important transcription factors in regulating fut3 expression , we presented the potential transcription factor binding sites ( tfbs ) found within cpg sites in the core promoter region of pig fut3 genes , such as sp1 , hif1a , ap2 , usf , c / ebpα , and creb ( figure 4d ) .	bind	1		0	hif1a|creb|transcription|factors|fut3|tfbs|sp1|ap2|usf|c|/|ebpα	12
8535959	body	based on transcription factor prediction , we investigated several important transcription factors in fut3 promoter cpg sites , which belongs to the methylation - dependent transcription factors and include hypoxia - inducible factor ( hif )  - 1α ( hif1a ) [ 28 ] , specificity protein 1 ( sp1 ) [ 29,30 ] , camp response element - binding proteins ( creb ) [ 31 ] , upstream transcription factor ( usf ) [ 32 ] , ccaat / enhancer - binding protein β ( c / ebpβ ) [ 6 ] .	bind|bind	2		0	hif1a|creb|transcription|factor|factors|inducible|hif|specificity|protein|1|sp1|upstream|usf|c|/|ebpβ	16
