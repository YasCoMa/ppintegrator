7694162	body	dxs was discovered to be a stab2 / feel2 ligand in 2003 by tamura et al .	ligand	1		0	dxs|stab2	2
7694162	body	although dextran is not a mammalian molecule , the finding that highly sulfated dxs is recognized and internalized by hare / stab2 is significant , in that it indicates the dxs negative charge distribution patterns mimic those of bone fide human ligands .	ligand	1		0	dxs|stab2|mammalian|molecule	4
7694162	body	amazingly ha , cdr , cs - a and a gag - mimic ( dxs ) were the only gag ligands identified over 26 years ( 1981â€“2007 ) and then , within a year , the number of gag ligands shown to bind and be cleared by hare / stab2 more than doubled , to nine .	ligand|ligand|bind	3		0	dxs|stab2|cdr|cs|-|a|gag|ligands	8
6769870	body	finally , paso binding to recombinant stab2 is not inhibited by ha but is partially blocked by hep [ 17 ] , indicating that this ligand class binds in the general region that mediates binding to hep , ds , dxs and acldl ( figure 1a ) .	bind|block|ligand|bind|bind	5		0	stab2|dxs|recombinant|hep|acldl	5
