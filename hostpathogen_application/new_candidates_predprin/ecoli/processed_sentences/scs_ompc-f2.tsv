3050693	body	ompr - p binds to four ( f4 , f1 , f2 , and f3 from the 5 to 3 direction ) and three ( c1 , c2 , and c3 ) sites within the upstream regions of ompf and ompc , respectively , with each containing two tandem 10 bp subsites ( a and b ) bound by two ompr - p molecules .	bind	1		0	f2|ompc|ompr|f4|f1|f3|c1|c2|c3|ompf	10
3050693	body	at low osmolarity , ompr - p tandemly binds to f1 and f2 ( and somewhat loosely to f3 ) in order to activate the transcription of ompf ; meanwhile ompr - p occupies c1 but not c2 and c3 , which is not sufficient to stimulate the transcription of ompc .	bind	1		0	f2|ompc|ompr|f1|f3|ompf|c1|c2|c3	9
5311971	body	a multiple sequence alignment showed that the three possible binding sites , especially b1 , resemble the consensus ompr binding sites for ompf and ompc ( f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 and c1 ) and include conserved nucleotides that are important for ompr binding24 .	bind|bind	2		0	ompc|f2|b1|ompf|f1|f3|f4|c1|ompr	9
10096019	abstract	using 1,10 - phenanthroline - cu+ footprinting on a fused construct containing both the ompf and ompc upstream regulatory sequences , and gel shift experiments on oligomers corresponding to individual sites , we have established a comparative hierarchy for ompr binding , as f1 , c1 & gt ; f2 , f3 & gt ; c2 & gt ; c3 .	bind	1		0	ompc|f2|ompr|f1|c1|f3|c2|c3	8
