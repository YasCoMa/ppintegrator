5320443	abstract	this study investigated the effect of n - linked glycosylation on the binding of herceptin to her2 protein in breast cancer and on the sensitivity of cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin ( dxr ) and growth factors ( egf and igf - 1 ) .	bind	1		0	dxr|egf|herceptin|her2|protein|growth|factors|igf|-|1	10
5320443	body	in particular , the interaction between the biological ( monoclonal antibody ) treatment herceptin with her2 receptors on cancer cell surfaces and the sensitivity of cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent dxr was considered alongside the effect of glycosylation on cancer cell sensitivity to the growth factors egf and igf - 1 .	interact	1		0	dxr|egf|monoclonal|antibody|her2|receptors|growth|factors|igf|-|1	11
8387475	body	mechanistically , trametinib blocks oncogenic egf signaling and concomitantly ensures the integrity of the gsk3β–sirt7 axis , which guarantees subsequent activation by fasting and enhances the efficacy of dxr treatment .	block	1		0	egf|dxr|trametinib|oncogenic	4
