4820811	body	we show that foxe3 regulates dnajb1 expression while a previously published promoter analysis of hsp40 , a human homologue of bacterial dnaj , revealed that its promoter contains a consensus heat shock element dna - binding sequence for heat shock factor 1 ( hsf1 ) 25 .	bind	1		0	dnajb1|dnaj|foxe3|hsp40|bacterial|heat|shock|factor|1|hsf1	10
6080806	body	dnaj homology subfamily b member 1 ( dnajb1 ) , also known as heat shock protein 40 ( hsp40 ) , is a co - chaperone that interacts with heat shock protein 70 ( hsp70 ) [ 1 ] .	interact	1		0	dnaj|dnajb1|heat|shock|protein|40|hsp40|70|hsp70	9
5549762	body	of note , a systematic characterization of hsp70 chaperone complexes in human cells identified mlf1 and mlf2 as potential partners of dnaj - 1 homologs , dnajb1 , b4 and b6 [ ] , a finding corroborated by dyer et al .	complex	1		0	dnaj|dnajb1|hsp70|chaperone|complexes|mlf1|mlf2|b4|b6	9
6485077	body	these results suggest that cn - dnaja1and dnajb1 probably act as a partner in the hsp70 chaperone complex via a mechanism similar to that observed in e. coli dnaj , which employs the hpd motif as the contact site for hsp70 [ ] .	complex	1		0	dnaja1and|dnajb1|dnaj|cn|hsp70|chaperone|complex	7
6468197	abstract	it is characterized by a heterozygous approximately 400 - kb deletion on chromosome 19 that results in a unique fusion between dnaj heat shock protein family member b1 ( dnajb1 ) and the alpha catalytic subunit of protein kinase a ( prkaca ) .	subunit	1		0	dnaj|dnajb1|alpha|catalytic|subunit|protein|kinase|a|prkaca	9
6468197	body	several studies have identified and validated a single recurrent mutation that occurs in approximately 80 % –100 % of flc tumors.4 , 5 this mutation , a heterozygous ∼400 - kb deletion on chromosome 19 , fuses exon 1 of dnaj heat shock protein family member b1 ( dnajb1 ) with exons 2–10 of the α catalytic subunit of protein kinase a ( prkaca ) .	subunit	1		0	dnaj|dnajb1|α|catalytic|subunit|protein|kinase|a|prkaca	9
