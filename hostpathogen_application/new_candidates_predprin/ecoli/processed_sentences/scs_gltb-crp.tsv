1784095	body	third , we determined the effects of the membrane - permeable derivative dibutyryl - camp on expression of gltb - lacz with and without alteration of the crp binding sequence .	bind	1		0	gltb|crp	2
1784095	body	the crp footprint is centered at  - 65.5 relative to the start of gltb transcription , close to the position from which crp activates class i promoters [ 35 ] where crp binds between the c - terminal domain of rpoa ( αctd ) and region 4 of rpod ( σ70 ) .	bind	1		0	crp|gltb|c|-|terminal|domain|rpoa|αctd|rpod	9
1784095	body	construction of pgltb - lacz fusion and variant with altered crp - binding site the promoter region upstream of gltb was amplified from e. coli chromosomal dna using primers gltp1 - 2 ( table 2 ) , and the resulting pcr product was digested with bamhi and sali .	bind	1		0	pgltb|crp|gltb|gltp1|table|2|bamhi|sali	8
