5726836	body	pathophysiology mitochondrial iscs process is crucial for the biosynthesis of mitochondrial , cytosolic and nuclear fe - s containing proteins.29 - 31 in eukaryotes , iscs are present in 2 forms : [ 2fe - 2s ] rhombic , and [ 4fe - 4s ] cubane.32 the process is composed of three sequential steps ( figure 1 ) ; the first step starts by sulfur donation from cysteine desulfurase ( nfs ) , which in turn forms a complex with the stabilizing protein lyrm4 , to complete the reaction and release sulfane (  - ssh ) .33,34 simultaneously , iron is imported into the mitochondria through the inner membrane protein , slc25a37 ( mitochondrial iron transporter 1 ) .35 meanwhile fxn probably ( as there is no clear evidence ) acts as iron chaperone to deliver the imported iron to scaffold protein iscu and regulates the above mentioned cysteine desulfurase reaction.36,37 a reduction reaction then takes place by fdx2 and fdxr to reduce sulfane to sulfide , after which fe - s assembly is accomplished on iscu.14,38,39 in the second step , a series of proteins , hsc20 , hspa9 and grpe like 1 , react with the fe - s loaded iscu leading to detachment of [ 2fe - 2s ] cluster.20,40 monothiol glrx5 then binds transiently to the released [ 2fe - 2s ] , in coordination with tripeptide glutathione to form a glutathione - containing complex41,42 and finally transfer the mature [ 2fe - 2s ] cluster to apoproteins or export it outside the mitochondria , through the inner membrane protein abcb7,27 to take part in the cytosol iron assembly ( cia ) machinery .	complex|bind	2		0	hspa9|grpe|iscs|nfs|lyrm4|inner|membrane|protein|slc25a37|fdx2|fdxr|hsc20|glrx5|apoproteins	14
