2994776	body	as expected , the amino acid sequences of the control peptides yielded dnak binding with scores in a range of  - 1.53 ( c2 ) and  - 5.29 ( c3 ) .	bind	1		0	dnak|c3|amino|acid|sequences|c2	6
2994776	body	dnak was allowed to bind to a cellulose membrane carrying 50 spots of overlapping 13 - mer preproinsulin peptides and three spots of control peptides ( c1 , c2 , c3 ) followed by electroelution and identification of eluted dnak by specific antibody and chemiluminescence .	bind	1		0	dnak|c3|c1|c2|eluted	5
2994776	body	the amounts of dnak released during elution cycles 2 and 3 were compared with the release of dnak from the high affinity control ligand c3 ( set as 1 in figure 3a ) .	ligand	1		0	dnak|c3|elution|cycles|2|and|3	7
2994776	body	for this analysis the strength of the signals obtained from the high affinity dnak ligand c3 after each elution cycle ( cycle 1 : 134 lu ; cycle 2 : 46 lu ; cycle 3 : 33 lu ) was set as `` 1 '' and used as reference for the signal strengths obtained from the investigated peptides after the corresponding cycles of elution .	ligand	1		0	dnak|c3	2
2994776	body	binding of dnak to cellulose - bound preproinsulin peptides a set of 13 - mer peptides with an eleven amino acid overlap , covering the entire sequence of human preproinsulin ( 110 residues ) and three control peptides with known high dnak affinity ( c1 : wtynaellvllen ( w436  -  n448 from hemagglutinin ) ; c2 : gntlvivtadhah ( g382  -  h394 from alkaline phosphatase ) ; c3 : shamapvlylqdk ( s192  -  k204 from sigma 32 ) ) were synthesized in distinct spots on a cellulose membrane with an alanine - spacer at their cooh - terminus ( jerini bio tools gmbh , berlin , germany ) .	bind	1		0	dnak|c3|110|residues|n448|hemagglutinin|g382|alkaline|phosphatase|s192|cooh|-|terminus	13
6212839	body	when dnak / jvc are added to the reaction with either rctb or rctbd314p , the c3 complex is observed at all concentrations and has become majoritarian , suggesting an activation of the rctb oligomerization by dnak / jvc , as it is the case with crts .	complex	1		0	dnak|c3|jvc|rctb|rctbd314p|complex	6
6212839	body	emsa experiments show that rctb ( ± dnak / jvc ) form c1 , c2 and c3 complexes on both methylated iteron - containing probes ( supplementary figure s9b ) .	complex	1		0	dnak|c3|rctb|c2|complexes	5
6212839	body	emsa experiments show that rctbδiv ( ± dnak / jvc ) mostly form the c1 complex , while complexes c2 and c3 nearly completely disappeared .	complex|complex	2		0	dnak|c3|c1|complex|c2	5
