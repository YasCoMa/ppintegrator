7812288	abstract	tumour‐associated genes were integrated , and top 10 hub genes ( fyn , raf1 , atm , fos , creb , ncoa3 , vegfa , jak2 , crem and atf3 ) were identified by protein‐protein interaction ( ppi ) network , and oncomine was used to validate hub genes expression .	interact	1		0	creb|ncoa3|fyn|raf1|fos|vegfa|jak2|crem|atf3|ppi	10
6200366	body	this is what happened sometime between 600 and 540 million years ( ma ) ago for two intrinsically disordered protein ( idp ) domains : the nuclear coactivator binding domain ( ncbd ) from creb - binding protein [ crebbp , also called cbp , and its paralog p300 ( crebbp / p300 ) ] and the crebbp interaction domain ( cid ) from the nuclear coactivator protein [ nuclear receptor coactivator 1 ( ncoa1 ) , ncoa2 , and ncoa3 , also called src1 , tif2 , and actr , respectively ] .	bind|bind|interact	3		0	creb|crebbp|ncoa3|nuclear|coactivator|binding|domain|ncbd|cbp|p300|interaction|protein|ncoa1|ncoa2|src1|tif2	16
7565474	body	similarly to the ahrr - ncoa2 fusion , the sequence analysis showed that ahrr - ncoa3 encodes a protein possessing bhlh and pas domains of ahrr , and two transactivation domains for the steroid hormone receptor and creb - interacting domain of ncoa3 ( figure 2a ) , suggesting close functional similarity to transcriptional activators between the two fusion proteins .	interact	1		0	ncoa3|creb|ahrr|ncoa2|bhlh|pas|domains|transactivation|steroid|hormone|receptor|figure|2a|transcriptional|activators|fusion|proteins	17
