7927077	body	using surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) analysis , we determined that 6his - gltb bound to 6his - gtrs ( n - terminally 6his - tagged ligand - binding domain of gtrs , residues 29–199 ) with a dissociation constant ( k d ) of 0.1 μm ( c ) , which is much lower than the dissociation constant of either 2 - kg ( i.e. , 5 μm ) or 6 - phosphogluconate ( i.e. , 98 μm ) binding to the recombinant gtrs ligand - binding domain [ ] .	ligand|bind|bind|ligand|bind	5		0	spr|gltb|gtrs|ligand|-|binding|domain|recombinant	8
