5054386	body	hsp70 s are required for full prevention of parkin c289g aggregation to further consolidate that dnajs prevent aggregation of parkin c289g via an interaction with hsp70 s , we examined whether short interfering rna ( sirna )  - mediated knockdown of hspa1a had an effect on the dnaj mediated clearance of parkin c289g .	interact	1		0	dnajs|hspa1a|dnaj|hsp70	4
4515555	body	this is based on our observations that : ( 1 ) aβ42 - gfp does not form sds - insoluble aggregates ; ( 2 ) aβ42 - gfp aggregation is not seeded by exogenous aβ42 peptides ; ( 3 ) although dnajb6 was effective in preventing the aggregation of aβ42 - gfp model , it was dependent on functional interaction with hsp70 , unlike its mode of action as “ peptide chaperone ” ; ( 4 ) , other members of dnaj family , hspa1a and hspb1 that were only marginally effective as peptide chaperones were equally effective as dnajb6 in preventing aβ42 - gfp aggregation .	interact	1		0	dnajb6|dnaj|hspa1a|aβ42|gfp|sds|hsp70|family|hspb1	9
