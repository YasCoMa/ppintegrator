3050693	body	ompr - p binds to four ( f4 , f1 , f2 , and f3 from the 5 to 3 direction ) and three ( c1 , c2 , and c3 ) sites within the upstream regions of ompf and ompc , respectively , with each containing two tandem 10 bp subsites ( a and b ) bound by two ompr - p molecules .	bind	1		0	c2|ompc|ompr|f4|f1|f2|f3|c1|c3|ompf	10
3050693	body	at low osmolarity , ompr - p tandemly binds to f1 and f2 ( and somewhat loosely to f3 ) in order to activate the transcription of ompf ; meanwhile ompr - p occupies c1 but not c2 and c3 , which is not sufficient to stimulate the transcription of ompc .	bind	1		0	c2|ompc|ompr|f1|f2|f3|ompf|c1|c3	9
3050693	body	with increasing osmolarity , the cellular levels of ompr - p elevate , and ompr - p binds to c2 and c3 cooperatively , allowing for the transcription of ompc .	bind	1		0	c2|ompc|ompr|c3	4
166144	body	ompr , the transcription factor that activates transcription of both micf and ompc in response to osmolarity increase binds at three sites in e. coli , c1 , c2 , and c3 [ 18,20 ] .	bind	1		0	ompc|c2|ompr|transcription|factor|micf|c1|c3	8
10096019	abstract	while it has been possible to study the stoichiometry and hierarchy of the ompr - dna interaction in the upstream regions of ompf and ompc , their disunited location on the bacterial chromosome has made it difficult to compare the individual binding affinities of respective sites.using 1,10 - phenanthroline - cu+ footprinting on a fused construct containing both the ompf and ompc upstream regulatory sequences , and gel shift experiments on oligomers corresponding to individual sites , we have established a comparative hierarchy for ompr binding , as f1 , c1 & gt ; f2 , f3 & gt ; c2 & gt ; c3 .	interact|bind|bind	3		0	ompc|c2|ompr|ompf|f1|c1|f2|f3|c3	9
