3985919	abstract	a high - qualitynuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of the j - domain of dnaja1combined with a bioinformatics analysis and a ligand affinity screenidentifies a potential dnak binding site , which is also predictedto overlap with an inhibitory binding site , suggesting dnaja1 activityis highly regulated .	ligand|bind|bind	3		0	dnaja1combined|dnak|dnaja1|j|-|domain	6
3985919	body	thus , our preliminary results suggest dnaja1 potentially stimulatesthe dnak suppression of a jnk - induced anti - apoptotic signaling pathwayby forming a complex with dnak .	complex	1		0	dnaja1|dnak|jnk	3
